<p class="dcap">THE nucleus of the following pages was
originally written in the form of two
short papers to be read at the meetings
of a Public School Natural History
Society. Since then, finding materials rapidly
growing on our hands, we have been gradually
amplifying our notes on the subject until they have
grown to the present dimensions; for, to quote the
quaint words of Thomas Fuller, &ldquo;when there is
no recreation or business for thee abroad, thou
may&rsquo;st then have a company of honest old fellows
in leathern jackets in thy study, which may find
thee excellent divertisement at home.&rdquo; Our researches
in pursuit of the marvellous, through the
works of divers and sundry old writers, have been
so far entertaining and interesting to us that we
would fain hope that they may not be altogether
received without favour by others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
Our subject naturally divides itself into two very
obvious sections&mdash;the one dealing with wholly
untrue and impossible creatures of the fancy,
the other with the strange beliefs and fancies that
have clustered round the real creatures we see
around us. It will readily be discovered that we
have confined ourselves in the present volume
almost entirely to the first of these sections.
Should our present labours prove acceptable they
may readily be followed by a companion volume,
at least as entertaining, dealing with the second
section of our subject.</p>

<p class="dcap">ALL science is a gradual growth. Travellers
as they toil up a long ascent turn round
from time to time, and mark with satisfaction
the ever-lengthening way that stretches
between them and their distant starting-place, and
derive a further encouragement from the sight to press
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
onward to the yet unknown. So may we in this our day
compare ourselves, in no offensive and vainglorious way,
with the men of the past, and gain renewed courage
in the future as we leave their ancient landmarks far
behind us. Shame, indeed, would it be to us had
we not thus advanced, for our opportunities of gaining
knowledge are immeasurably greater than those of any
preceding generation.</p>

<p>The old herbals and books of travels abound in
curious examples of the quaint beliefs of our forefathers,
while their treatises on natural history are a still richer
storehouse. Many of the old tomes, again, on the science
of heraldry give other curious notions respecting the
different animals introduced. Some of these animals, as
the dragon or the griffin, are undoubtedly of the most
mythical nature, yet we find them described in the most
perfect good faith, and without the slightest suspicion as
to their real existence. We shall have occasion to refer
to several of the works of these old writers, and we will,
without further preface, take down from our book-shelf a
little book entitled &ldquo;A Description of 300 Animals.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

The name of Thomas Bewick is to all book-collectors &ldquo;familiar in
their mouths as household words,&rdquo; and we rarely read the account of
the dispersal of any large library or the choice collection of some
bibliophile without finding that it contained a choice edition of Bewick&rsquo;s
&ldquo;quadrupeds&rdquo; or &ldquo;birds&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;lot&rdquo; that always calls for a keen competition.
It is interesting to know that the book we have named above
considerably influenced him, and in no slight degree led to the production
of the works that will always remain his monument, for we find
him writing to a friend of his&mdash;&ldquo;From my first reading, when a boy
at school, a sixpenny history of birds and beasts, and then a wretched
composition called the &lsquo;History of Three Hundred Animals,&rsquo; to the time
I became acquainted with works of natural history written for the
perusal of men, I was never without the design of attempting something
of this kind myself.&rdquo; <a href="#FNanchor_1_1">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>No one person appears on the title-page as author,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
but it is stated that it is extracted from the best authorities
and adapted to the use of all capacities. It is also illustrated
with copper-plates &ldquo;whereon is curiously engraven
every beast, bird, fish, serpent, and insect, described in
the whole book.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;curiously&rdquo; is very happily
chosen, and most happily describes the extraordinary
nature of the illustrations. The preface shows us that
the primary intention of the book was the instruction
and entertainment of the young, and after wading painfully
through the cumbrous Roman figures, the long
array of C&rsquo;s, X&rsquo;s, and the like, we find that the date of
the treatise was 1786, or just a hundred years ago. Let
us, then, dip here and there into it and see what &ldquo;the
best authorities&rdquo; could teach our grandfathers when their
youthful minds would know something of the wonders
of creation. The lion, as the king of beasts, heads the
list. &ldquo;He is generally of a dun colour, but not without
some exceptions, as black, white, and red, in Ethiopia
and some other parts of Africa.&rdquo; The red lion, then, it
would appear, is no mere creation of the licensed victualler
or Garter King-at-Arms, no mere fancy to deck a signboard
withal or emblazon on a shield of honour, but a
living verity; and we may pause to remark that almost
all the most wonderful things in the book have their
home in Africa, not as now the playground of the
Royal Geographical Society, but an unknown land full
of wonder and mystery, of which nothing is too marvellous
to be impossible. We are told, too, that the lion
sleeps with his eyes open, and many other curious details
follow. On the next page the unicorn is in all sober
seriousness described. &ldquo;His head resembles a hart&rsquo;s,
his feet an elephant&rsquo;s, his tail a boar&rsquo;s, and the rest of
his body a horse&rsquo;s. The horn is about a foot and a half
in length, his voice is like the lowing of an ox, his horn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
is as hard as iron and as rough as any file.&rdquo; Burton in
his &ldquo;Miracles of Art and Nature,&rdquo; published in 1678,
says that in Ethiopia &ldquo;some Kine there are which have
Horns like Stags; other but one Horn only, and that in
the Forehead, about a foot and a half long, but bending
backward.&rdquo; It will be seen that Burton does not identify
these with the so-called unicorn, but the passage
is in some degree suggestive. Any one who has noticed
the fine series of antelopes in the collection of the Zoological
Society of London will scarcely have failed to
observe the length and straightness of the horns of some
of the species, while they are often so close together and
so nearly parallel in direction, that any one seeing the
animals at a little distance away, and so standing that
one of their horns covers the other, might well be
excused for starting the idea of single-horned animals.
Great virtues are attributed to the horn of the unicorn,
as the expelling of poison and the curing of many
diseases. The unicorn is very familiar to us as one of
the supporters of the royal arms, but the form we know
so well does not altogether agree with that described.
The heraldic unicorn is in all respects a horse save and
except the horn, while our old author tells us of the
head of a stag and the feet of an elephant. The creature
is sometimes referred to in our English version of the
Bible, and has thus become one of the animals introduced
in symbolic and religious art. In some of the
passages it would clearly seem to indicate that in the
very early days dealt with in some of the books of
the Bible there was a general belief in some such creature,
while in others probably the word is rather introduced
in error by our translators&mdash;an error that may
very well be pardoned when we find the animal gravely
described in the much more recent book before us. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
the book of Job, the earliest in point of time in the
whole Bible, the belief in some such animal seems very
distinctly indicated in the words, &ldquo;Will the unicorn be
willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib? Canst thou
bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow, or will he
harrow the valleys after thee?&rdquo; In the 92d Psalm the
peculiar feature that gives the creature its name is especially
referred to in the words, &ldquo;My horn shalt thou exalt
like the horn of a unicorn.&rdquo; The reference is always
to some wild and powerful animal; thus in Exodus we
read, &ldquo;His horns are like the horns of unicorns;&rdquo; and
again in one of the psalms we find David crying, &ldquo;Save
me from the lion&rsquo;s mouth, for Thou hast heard me from
the horns of the unicorns.&rdquo; Other passages might be
quoted, but these will amply suffice to indicate the very
early belief in some such creature. The form is frequently
seen in the earliest Christian art, as in the
catacombs of Rome, the havens of refuge for the living
and the resting-places of the dead followers of the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
faith. Our illustration is a facsimile of that in the
&ldquo;Description of 300 Animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason that we cannot now discover, the
unicorn was an especial favourite with the Scotch heralds,
and it is from them that we derive it in our royal arms.
Before the union of the two monarchies the supporters
of the arms of the English monarchs had been very
various, though in almost every case a lion had been one
of the two employed,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> while in Scotland for several reigns
before the amalgamation of the two countries the supporters
had been two unicorns. It was very naturally
arranged, therefore, when the two kingdoms were fused
together on the death of Elizabeth, that the joint shield
should be supported by the lion of England and the
unicorn of Scotland. The creature freely occurs as a
device on the Scottish coinage; one piece especially is
by collectors called the unicorn, from the conspicuous
introduction of the national device.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
As for example:&mdash;Henry VI., Lion and Antelope; Edward IV.,
Lion and Bull; Edward V., Two Lions; Richard III., Lion and Boar;

<p>We have already indicated that potent virtues were
believed to reside in the horn of the unicorn. In the
Comptes Royaux of France in 1391 we find a golden
cup with a slice of this horn in it for testing the food of
the Dauphin, and again in the inventory of Charles V.&mdash;&ldquo;Une
touche de licorne, garnie d&rsquo;or, pour faire essay.&rdquo;
Decker, again, in 1609 speaks of &ldquo;the unicorn, whose
horn is worth a city.&rdquo; In Mrs. Bury Palliser&rsquo;s most interesting
work of &ldquo;Historic Badges and Devices&rdquo; we find
an illustration of the standard of Bartolomeo d&rsquo;Alviano.
He was a great champion of the Orsini family, and took
a leading part in all the feuds that devastated Central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
Europe during his lifetime. His standard bears the
unicorn, surrounded by snakes, toads, and other reptiles
then rightly or wrongly held poisonous; these he is moving
aside with his horn, and above is the motto, &ldquo;I expel
poisons&rdquo;&mdash;he, d&rsquo;Alviano, of course, being the lordly and
potent unicorn, his foes the creeping things to be driven
from his face.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a></span>
The English Cyclop&aelig;dia of Natural History gives a description by
Ctesias of the Indian ass. He says that these animals are as large as
horses, and larger, having a horn on the forehead, one cubit long, which
for the extent of two palms from the forehead is entirely white; above,
it is pointed and red, being black in the middle. Of this horn drinking-cups
are formed, and those who use them are said not to be subject to
spasm or epilepsy, nor to the effects of poison, provided, either before
or after taking the poison, they drink out of the cup wine, water, or
any other liquid.</p>

<p>One of the Arabian annalists, El Kazwini, has much to say about the
magical and curative properties of these cups; and a yet fuller notice
of them appears in Lane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; chap. xx. note 32. It is
also stated that most of the Eastern potentates possessed one of these
cups. In Hyder Ali&rsquo;s treasury at Tanjore was found a specimen.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Uganda and the Egyptian Soudan,&rdquo; by the Rev. C.&nbsp;T. Wilson
and R.&nbsp;W. Felkin, vol. ii. p. 275, we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cups made of rhinoceros horn are supposed to have the peculiar
virtue of detecting poison in coffee and sherbet. Often, when drinking
for the first time in a strange house, one of these cups is offered to
assure the visitor that no foul play is contemplated. These are considered
most valuable presents and a mark of lasting friendship and
esteem.&rdquo; <a href="#FNanchor_3_3">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the &ldquo;Display of Heraldry&rdquo; published by John
Guillim in the year 1679 we read&mdash;&ldquo;It hath been much
questioned amongst naturalists, which it is that is properly
called the Unicorn; and some have made doubt
whether there be any such Beast as this or no. But the
great esteem of his horn (in many places to be seen)
may take away that needless scruple.&rdquo; Having thus
satisfactorily established the existence of such a creature
he naturally feels at full liberty to group around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
central fact divers details, as, for instance, that &ldquo;the wild
Beasts of the wilderness use not to drink of the Pools,
for fear of venomous Serpents there breeding, before the
Unicorn hath stirred it with its horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems to have been a debateable point whether the
unicorn had ever been taken alive, but Guillim decisively
negatives the idea, and naturally avails himself of it for
the greater glorification of the creature and of its service
in his beloved science of heraldry. He lays down the
broad fact that the unicorn is never taken alive, and
here surely we can thoroughly go with him; but &ldquo;the
reason being demanded, it is answered that the greatness
of his mind is such that he chuseth rather to die, wherein
the unicorn and the valiant-minded soldier are alike,
which both contemn death, and rather than they will
be compelled to undergo any base servitude and bondage
they will lose their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip de Thaun, on the other hand, not only admits
the idea that the unicorn may be captured alive, but
gives the full receipt for doing so. It would appear
that, like Una&rsquo;s lion, the animal is of a particularly impressionable
nature, and is always prepared to do homage
to maiden beauty and innocence, and this amiable trait
in its character is basely taken advantage of. &ldquo;When
a man intends to hunt and take and ensnare it he goes
to the forest where is its repair, and there places a virgin.
Then it comes to the virgin, falls asleep on her lap, and
so comes to its death. The man arrives immediately and
kills it in its sleep, or takes it alive and does as he will
with it.&rdquo; The young ladies of that very indefinite date
must have possessed considerably more courage and nerve
than some of their sisters of the present day, who show
symptoms of hysteria if they find themselves in the same
room with a spider&mdash;a considerably less severe test than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
an interview in the dark shades of the forest with an
amorous unicorn. One cannot, however, help feeling that
the victim of misplaced confidence comes out of the
transaction most creditably, and that both man and
maiden must have felt what schoolboys call &ldquo;sneaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unicorn, alive or dead, seems to have eluded
observation in a wonderful way, and the men of science
were left to extract their facts from the slightest hints,
in the same way that distinguished anatomists and
geologists of these later days are enabled to build up
an entire animal from one or two isolated bones. The
process, however, does not seem, in the case of the
earlier men, to have been a very successful one, and
there is consequently a great clashing amongst the
authorities, and one of the medi&aelig;val writers, feeling the
difficulty of drawing any very definite result from the
chaos before him, adopts the plan, in which we humbly
follow him, of simply putting it all down just as it comes
to hand, and leaving his readers to make the best they
can of it. He writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pliny affirmeth it is a fierce and terrible creature,
Vartomannus a tame animal: those which Garcias ab
Horto described about the Cape of Good Hope were
beheld with heads like horses, those which Vartomannus
beheld he described with the head of a Deere: Pliny,
&AElig;lian, Solinus, and Paulus Venetus affirm the feet of
the Unicorn are undivided and like the Elephant&rsquo;s, but
those two which Vartomannus beheld at Mecha were, as
he described, footed like a Goate. As &AElig;lian describeth
it, it is in the bignesse of an Horse, that which Thevet
speaketh of was not so big as an Heifer, but Paulus
Venetus affirmeth that they are but little lesse than
Elephants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On turning to the records of a distinguished French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Society established in 1633 we come across many strange
items. These records are entitled &ldquo;A general collection
of the Discourses of the Virtuosi of France, upon questions
of all sorts of philosophy and other natural knowledge,
made in the Assembly of the Beaux Esprits at
Paris by the most ingenious persons of that nation.&rdquo;
Their meetings were termed conferences, and there are
notes of two hundred and forty of these. The subjects
discussed covered a very wide field, the following being
some few amongst them&mdash;Of the end of all things, of
perpetual motion, of the echo, of how long a man may
continue without eating, whether is to be preferred a
great stature or a small, of the loadstone, of the origin
of mountains, and who are the most happy in this world,
wise men or fools. Some of these subjects are now
definitely settled, while others are as open to discussion
as ever, as, for example, the questions whether it be expedient
for women to be learned, and whether it be better
to bury or to burn the bodies of the dead. In this
great accumulation of the notions of the seventeenth
century we find, amongst other items that more especially
concern our present purpose, discussions on genii, on the
ph&oelig;nix, and on the unicorn.</p>

<p>In the early days of a similar institution, our own
Royal Society&mdash;a body which is now so staid, and which
focuses all the most important scientific results of the
day to itself&mdash;many points were discussed in perfect good
faith that are now consigned to oblivion&mdash;the trees that
grow diamonds, the rivers that run precious gems, and the
seeds that fell from heaven being amongst these; while
at another meeting we find the Duke of Buckingham
presenting the Society with a piece of the horn of the
unicorn.</p>

<p>The old writers had no very definite system, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
the author of the &ldquo;Book of the 300 Animals&rdquo; may seem to
have exercised a certain fitness in discussing the unicorn
directly after the lion, the conjunction is probably wholly
accidental, as the creatures dwelt on succeed each other
in all such books in the most arbitrary way. The next
animal to which we would refer is the wolf. He is not
absolutely the next in the series, but we manifestly cannot
deal with the whole three hundred, so we pick out here
and there divers quaint examples of what we may be
allowed to term this unnatural history. We are told
that &ldquo;the wolf is a very ravenous creature, and as
dangerous to meet with, when hungry, as any beast
whatever, but when his stomach is full, he is to men
and beasts as meek as a lamb. When he falls upon a
hog or a goat, or such small beasts, he does not immediately
kill them, but leads them by the ear, with all the
speed he can, to a crew of ravenous wolves, who instantly
tear them to pieces.&rdquo; We should have thought that the
reverse had been more probable, that the wolves that
had nothing would have come with all the speed they
could upon their more successful companion; but if the
old writer&rsquo;s story be true, it opens out a fine trait of unselfishness
in the character of this maligned communard.
It was an old belief, a fancy that we find in the pages
of Pliny, Theocritus, Virgil, and others, that a man becomes
dumb if he meets a wolf and the wolf sees him
first. A medi&aelig;val writer explains this as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
ground or occasionall originall hereof was probably
the amazement and sudden silence the unexpected appearance
of Wolves doe often put upon travellers, not
by a supposed vapour or venemous emanation, but a
vehement fear which naturally produceth obmutescence
and sometimes irrecoverable silence. Thus birds are
silent in presence of an Hawk, and Pliny saith that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
Dogges are mute in the shadow of an Hy&aelig;na, but thus
could not the mouths of worthy Martyrs be stopped, who
being exposed not only unto the eyes but the mercilesse
teeth of Wolves, gave loud expressions of their faith, and
their holy clamours were heard as high as heaven.&rdquo;
Scott refers to the old belief in his &ldquo;Quentin Durward.&rdquo;
In the eighteenth chapter our readers will find as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Our
young companion has seen a wolf,&rsquo; said Lady
Hameline, &lsquo;and has lost his tongue in consequence.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The thirteenth animal is the &ldquo;Rompo&rdquo; or Man-eater;
he is &ldquo;so called because he feeds upon dead men, to
come at which he greedily grubs up the earth off their
graves, as if he had notice of somebody there hid. He
keeps in the woods; his body is long and slender, being
about three feet in length, with a long tail. The negroes
say that he does not immediately fall on as soon as he
has found the body, but goes round and round it several
times as if afraid to seize it. Its head and mouth are
like a hare&rsquo;s, his ears like a man&rsquo;s, his fore feet like a
badger&rsquo;s, and his hinder feet like a bear&rsquo;s. It has likewise
a mane. This creature is bred in India and Africa.&rdquo;
Concerning the buffalo we read, &ldquo;It is reported of this
creature that when he is hunted or put into a fright
he&rsquo;ll change his colour to the colour of everything he
sees; as amongst trees he is green, &amp;c.&rdquo; The Manticora
is one of the strange imaginings of our forefathers. In
the illustration in the book (of which our figure is a
reproduction) it has a human head and face and a body
like that of a lion; a thick mane covers the neck; its tail
is much longer in proportion than that of a lion, and has
at its extremity a most formidable collection of spiky-looking
objects; these in the description are said to be
stinging and sharply-pointed quills. He is as big as a
lion. &ldquo;His voice is like a small trumpet. He is so wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
that it is very difficult to catch him, and as swift as an
hart. With his tail he wounds the hunters, whether they
come before him or behind him. When the Indians
take a whelp of this beast they bruise its tail to prevent
it bearing the sharp quills; then it is tamed without
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/ml03.jpg" width="388" height="250"

</div>

<p>The Lamia, too, is an extraordinary creature, and one
that our not remote forefathers seem to have thoroughly
believed in, for though the author says that there are
many fictitious stories respecting it, he goes on to describe
it, and gives an illustration. It is thought to be
the swiftest of all four-footed creatures, so that its prey
can seldom or never escape it. It is said to be bred in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Libya, and to have a face like a beautiful woman, while
its voice is the hiss of a serpent. The body is covered
with scales. The old author tells us that they sometimes
devour their own young, and we may fairly hope that
this cannibal propensity of theirs is the cause of their
disappearance. In earlier times men believed in a
monstrous spectre called an Empusa. It could assume
various forms, and it was believed to feed on human
flesh. The Lami&aelig;, who took the forms of handsome
and graceful women for the purpose of beguiling poor
humanity, and then sucked their blood like vampyres
and devoured their flesh, were one form of Empusa.
The belief in some such creature seems to have been
widespread; the myth of the Sirens is, for example, very
similar in conception. In Mansfield Parkyns&rsquo; &ldquo;Life in
Abyssinia&rdquo; we read&mdash;&ldquo;There is an animal which I know
not where to class, as no European has hitherto succeeded
in obtaining a specimen of it. It is supposed by
the natives to be far more active, powerful, and dangerous
than the lion, and consequently held by them in the
greatest possible dread. They look upon it more in
the light of an evil spirit, with an animal&rsquo;s form, than
a wild beast; they assert that its face is human.&rdquo; We
learn, however, from the rest of the description, that this
creature possesses itself of its prey by force alone; the
human face is one further feature of terror, but does not,
as in the previous case, serve to beguile mankind and
lure them by its beauty to their fate.</p>

<p>The stag is said to be &ldquo;a great enemy to all kinds
of serpents, which he labours to destroy whenever he
finds any, but he is afraid of almost all other creatures.&rdquo;
Many of these old beliefs were simply handed down
from generation to generation without question, or the
opinions of the ancients accepted without experiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
or inquiry. This belief of the natural enmity of the
stag to the serpent is at least as old as Pliny, and
may be found duly set forth in the thirty-third chapter
of his eighth book:&mdash;&ldquo;This kind of deere make fight
with serpents, and are their natural and mortal enemies;
they will follow them to their verie holes, and then by
the strength of drawing and snuffing up their wind of
their nostrils, force them out whether they will or no.
The serpent sometimes climbs upon its back and bites
it cruelly, when the stag rushes to some river or fountain
and throws itself into the water to rid itself of its
enemy.&rdquo; This old belief made the stag a favourite
in the medi&aelig;val days of exaggerated symbolism, its ruthless
antipathy to the serpent rendering it not inaptly an
emblem of the Christian fighting to the death against
sin, and finding an antidote to its wounds in the fountain
of living water. It was also believed that stags &ldquo;passe
the seas swimming by flockes and whole heards in a long
row, each one resting his head upon his fellow next
before him; and this they do in course, so as the foremost
retireth behind to the hindmost by turnes, one
after another.&rdquo; In this supposed fact the seekers after
symbol and hidden meaning found no difficulty in recognising
that comfort and support in all their trials that
all good men should at all times be ready to afford their
fellows.</p>

<p>The tusks of the wild boar, we are told, cut like
sharp knives when the animal is alive, but lose their
keenness at his death. It is said when this creature is
hunted down his tusks are so inflamed that they will
burn and singe the hair of the dogs. The wild ox has
a tongue so hard and rough that it can draw a man to
him, &ldquo;whom by licking he can wound to death.&rdquo; The
elephant, we are told on the same authority, has two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
tusks. &ldquo;One of them it keeps always sharp to revenge
injuries, and with the other it roots up trees and plants
for its meat. These they lose once in ten years, which,
falling off, they very carefully bury in the earth on purpose
that men may not find them.&rdquo; The liver of a mouse
our forefathers believed to increase and decrease with
the waxing and waning of the moon. &ldquo;For every day of
the moon&rsquo;s age there is a fibre increase in their liver.&rdquo;
This rash and random assertion it would be manifestly
impossible either to prove or disprove, though one may
have one&rsquo;s own strong opinion on the matter. It would
be necessary to kill the mouse to count the aforesaid
fibres, and having killed it, the morrow&rsquo;s extra age of the
moon would bring no added fibres to the victim of our
credulity. Presently we come to the Potto, a creature
that is probably the same as we now call the sloth. The
illustration shows us a most hopelessly helpless-looking
animal, and in the description that accompanies it we
are told that a whole day is little enough for it to advance
ten steps forward. We are also informed that when he
does climb a tree he does not leave it until he has eaten
up not only the fruit but all the foliage, when &ldquo;he
descends fat and in good case, but before he can get
up another tree he loses all the advantages of his previous
good quarters and often perishes of hunger.&rdquo; Eighty-seven
quadrupeds are dealt with, so it will be readily
seen how little we have drawn upon the wealth of information
the book affords.</p>

<p>Book IV. of the treatise is devoted to the consideration
of serpents and insects. Amongst serpents and insects
the dragon naturally takes the place of honour. The
writer evidently has his doubts, and carefully qualifies
his description by a free use of the responsibility evading
formula &ldquo;it is said.&rdquo; He gives three illustrations. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
of them represents a biped monster, crested and winged;
the second has lost his legs, though he retains crest and
wings; while the third creature is of serpentine nature,
has neither wings nor legs, and only differs from the
serpent forms in the book by the addition of his crest.
The description runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The dragon, as described
in the numerous fables and stories of several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
writers, may be justly questioned whether he really exists.
I have read of serpents bred in Arabia, called Sirenas,
which have wings, being very swift, running and flying
at pleasure; and when they wound a man he dieth instantly.
These are supposed to be a kind of dragons.
It is said there are divers sorts of dragons or serpents
that are so called, which are distinguished partly by
their countries, partly by their magnitude, and partly
by the different form of their external parts. They are
said to be bred in India and Africa; those of India are
much the largest, being of an incredible length; and of
these there are also said to be two kinds, one of them
living in the marshes, which are slow of pace and without
combs on their heads; the other in the mountains,
which are bigger and have combs, their backs being
somewhat brown and their bodies less scaled. Some of
them are of a yellow fiery colour, having sharp backs
like saws. These also have beards. When they set up
their scales they shine like silver. The apples of their
eyes are (it is said) precious stones, and as bright as
fire, in which it is affirmed there is a great virtue against
many diseases. Their aspect is very fierce and terrible.
Some dragons are said to have wings and no feet; some,
again, have both feet and wings; and others neither feet
nor wings, and are only distinguished from the common
sort of serpents by the combs growing upon their heads
and by their beards. Some do affirm that the dragon is
of a black colour, somewhat green beneath and very
beautiful, that it has a triple row of teeth in each jaw,
that it has also two dewlaps growing under the chin,
which hang down like a beard of a red colour; and the
body is set all over with sharp scales, and on the
neck with thick hair, much like the bristles of a wild
boar.&rdquo; It will be seen by the foregoing that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
imagination of our ancestors was allowed free play, abundant
variety of form, magnitude, colour, and so forth
being possible.</p>

<p>The dragon or winged serpent has formed a part in
many creeds, and the dragon-slayer has been the hero
of countless legends. The legend varies with climate
and country, and with the development of the race in
which it is found; and yet the prophecies of the Bible of
the ultimate bruising of the serpent&rsquo;s head and the final
victory over the dragon (&ldquo;That old serpent, which is the
Devil and Satan&rdquo; Rev. xx. 2); the legends of classic days,
such as that of Perseus and Andromeda; the still older
struggles recorded in the slabs of Nineveh and Persepolis;
the stories narrated to awed rings of listeners in
the stillness of the Eastern night, or listened to by
our children with eager eyes and rapt attention in the
homes of England; the mass of legend that in medi&aelig;val
times clustered around the names of God&rsquo;s faithful ones;
and the local traditions of every land, from the equator
to the poles, all dwell on the mischievous presence of
some evil principle and record the ultimate triumph of
good. Beneath the mass of ever-varying fable stands
the like foundation, the strife between the two antagonistic
principles; and thus the wide world over, in every
age and in every clime, the mind of man, in broken
accents, it may be, and with faltering tongue, records
with joy its upward struggle, feels the need of help in
the sore conflict, registers its belief in final triumph.
Though the dragon-conflict occurs in many literatures,
the same incidents occur over and over again, and we
find in almost all the power and subtlety of the monster,
the innocence and helplessness of his victims, the
suddenness of his attack on them, and the completeness
of his final overthrow, the dragon-slayers being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
conquerors over tyranny and wrong, over paganism and
every form of godless evil.</p>

<p>In Egypt he was Typhon, in Greece, Python. In
India he is Kalli Naga, the thousand-headed, the foe and
the vanquished of Vishnu. In Anglo-Saxon chronicles
he is Lig-draca, the fire-drake or godes-andsacan, the
denier of God&mdash;always unsleeping, poison-fanged, relentless,
the terrible enemy of man, full of subtlety and full
of power.</p>

<p>On the advent of Christianity these ancient legends
were not wholly discarded, but suggested others of a like
character, and a slight alteration transferred to saint or
martyr those feats and victories which had formerly been
ascribed to gods and demigods. It only remained for
the new religion to point out the analogy, and to incorporate
into itself the lessons they taught, the conflict won,
the abnegation of self for the good of others.</p>

<p>It would take up far too much space if we were to
endeavour to give many of these legends in detail. In
some cases they were doubtless intended as descriptions
of an actual conflict, by force of arms, with some real
monster; but in others the conflict is allegorical; thus
St. Loup, St. Martin of Tours, St. Hilary, and St.
Donatus are all notable dragon-slayers, though the conflict
was a mythical one, and their claim to regard on
this score is based really on their gallant fight with
either the heathenism of those amongst whom they
laboured or the heresy of false brethren. The popular
saint, too, receives often more than his due at the hands
of his admirers, and legends gather thickly round his
name, and his so-called biography is often romance and
hero-worship from beginning to end. St. Romanus at
Rouen, St. Veran at Arles, and St. Victor of Marseilles
are all accredited with feats of dragon-slaying; but leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
them, St. Martial, St. Marcel, and many others to other
chroniclers, we content ourselves with referring to two
illustrious saints alone&mdash;the first because she is a lady,
and may therefore well claim our courtesy, the second
because he is our own patron saint.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that the sister of
Lazarus, the St. Martha of our legend, together with Mary
Magdalene and two companions, Maxime and Marcellus,
wandered so far away from Palestine as the shores of
France. How much farther they may have intended
to go the history does not tell us, but the untoward
accident that stranded them on the shores of Languedoc
was a most fortunate circumstance for the people of the
district. The inhabitants of that region had been for
some time tormented by a monster who fed on human
flesh and had a most draconic appetite, and they at once
appealed to these strangers to help them. This alone
would seem to indicate the extremity in which they found
themselves, or they would scarcely have applied to four
shipwrecked strangers, half of them women, for aid in
the hour of their necessity. St. Martha, however, in
pitying consideration for their sad plight, at once agreed
to help them. She had hardly entered the wood where
the monster dwelt before the most frightful bellowings
were heard, at which all the people sorely trembled and
naturally concluded that this unarmed woman had fallen
a victim to her temerity; but this alarming bellowing
shortly ceased, and soon after St. Martha reappeared,
holding in one hand a little wooden cross, and in the
other a ribbon, with which she led forth her interesting
captive. She then advanced into the middle of the
town and presented the people with the dragon, as embarrassing
a present as the proverbial white elephant; but
they seem to have risen to the occasion, for we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
afterwards an annual festival held in honour of the
Saint, while good King R&eacute;n&eacute; of Anjou instituted an
Order of the Dragon for the more effectual keeping alive
of the memory of the event. As St. Martha is more
especially set down in the &ldquo;Lives of the Saints&rdquo; as the
patron saint of good housewives, she might well have
been excused had she declined a service in itself so
dangerous and so far removed from the daily round,
the trivial task; but the overthrowing of the mighty by
an instrument so weak gives additional point to the
story, and vindicates triumphantly the power of faith
over evil.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Legenda Aurea,&rdquo; written by Jacobus de Voraigne,
Archbishop of Genoa, in the year 1260, is what Warton
termed &ldquo;an inexhaustible repository of religious fable.&rdquo;
For some centuries it was considered to have an almost
sacred character, and its popularity was so great that it
passed through an immense number of editions in the
Latin, Dutch, German, and French languages. It should
have the more interest to us, too, from the fact that it
was one of the earliest of English printed books, Caxton
publishing the first English edition in 1493. This was
followed by other editions by Wynkyn de Worde in the
years 1498, 1512, and 1527. The following account of
our patron saint is taken from this source, a much less
favourable history being found in Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Once upon a time the neighbourhood of the city of
Sylene was infested with an enormous dragon, who,
making a &ldquo;ponde, lyke a sea,&rdquo; which skirted the walls,
his usual residence, was accustomed to envenom the
miserable citizens with his pestiferous breath, and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
they gave him every day two sheep for his dinner,
and when these were spent they chose by lot a male and
female, daily, whom they exposed to the monster. At
length, after many of the rich had been compelled to
sacrifice their offspring, the lot fell upon the king&rsquo;s
daughter, a lovely maiden, and the idol of a fond father,
who, in the bitterness of his grief, entreated his subjects
for the love of the gods to take his gold and silver, and
all that he had, and spare his child; but they replied that
he had himself made the law, and that they had suffered
in obeying it, and concluded by telling him that unless
he complied with his own mandate, they would take off
his head. This answer only increased the king&rsquo;s affliction;
but being anxious to defer, if he could not avert, his
daughter&rsquo;s death, he craved that a respite of eight days
might be given her; and his people, moved, apparently,
by the groans and tears of the sorrowful old man, granted
his request. When the stipulated time had elapsed, they
came and said to him, &ldquo;Ye see how the city perisheth!&rdquo;
So the monarch bade his child array herself in her richest
apparel, and led her forth to &ldquo;the place where the dragon
was, and left her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It chanced that St. George, who, like a true knight-errant,
was travelling in quest of dangerous adventures,
arrived at the spot not long after the king&rsquo;s departure,
and was much astonished when he beheld so fair a lady
lingering there alone and weeping bitterly, and riding up
he asked the cause of her sorrow. But she, unwilling to
detain him in a place so perilous, entreated him to leave
her to her fate. &ldquo;Go on your way, young man,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;lest ye perish also.&rdquo; But St. George would know
the truth, so the maiden told him. Then was the knight&rsquo;s
heart merry within him, and he rejoined, &ldquo;Fayre doughter,
doubte ye no thynge hereof, for I shall helpe thee in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
name of Jesu Christe.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;For Goddes sake,
good knyght, goo your waye, and abyde not wyth me,
for ye may not deliver me.&rdquo; St. George, however, was
of a different opinion, and indeed, had he resolved, upon
second thoughts, to escape, he could not have done so,
for the dragon, smelling human flesh from afar, emerged
from the lake while the lady was speaking, and now
came running towards his victim. Not a moment was
to be lost, so St. George crossed himself, drew his sword,
and placing his lance in the rest, rushed to meet the
monster, who, little expecting such a rough greeting,
received the weapon &ldquo;in his bosom,&rdquo; and rolled over
in the dust. Then said the victor to the rescued virgin,
&ldquo;Take thy girdle, and bind it round the dragon&rsquo;s neck;&rdquo;
and when the lady had obeyed her champion, the
monster followed her as if it had been &ldquo;a meek beeste
and debonayre.&rdquo; And so she led him into the city; and
when the people saw her coming they fled with affright,
expecting to perish all of them; but St. George shouted,
&ldquo;Doubt nothing, believe in God Jesus Christ, consent to
be baptized, and I will slay the dragon before your eyes.&rdquo;
The citizens immediately consented, so the Saint attacked
the monster, and smote off his head, and commanded
that he should be thrown into the green fields, and
they took four carts with oxen, and drew him out of
the city. Then were fifteen thousand men baptized
(without reckoning the women and children), and the
king erected a church, and dedicated it to Our Lady and
St. George, in which floweth &ldquo;a founteyne of lyuying
water which heleth seeke people that drynke therof.&rdquo;
After this the prince offered the champion incalculable
riches, but he refused them all, and enjoining the king
to take care of the church, to honour the priests, and
pity the poor, he kissed him and departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
Some time after this marvellous event the Emperor
Diocletian so cruelly persecuted the Christians, that
&ldquo;twenty-two thousand were martyred in the course of
one month,&rdquo; and many others forsook God and sacrificed
to idols. When St. George heard this he laid
aside his arms, and sold his possessions, and took the
habit of a &ldquo;crysten-man,&rdquo; and went into the midst of
the &ldquo;paynims,&rdquo; and began to denounce their gods as
devils. &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;made heaven and earth,
He only is the true God.&rdquo; Then said they to him,
&ldquo;How dare ye defame our deities? Who art thou?&mdash;what
is thy name?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My name is George; I am a
gentleman and knight of Cappadocia, and I have left all
to serve my Lord,&rdquo; replied the Saint. Seeing that the
stranger was no common man, the ruler of that district
endeavoured to gain him over with fair words, but finding
the knight inflexible, he tied him aloft on a gibbet, and
caused him to be cruelly beaten; and then, having rubbed
salt into his wounds, he bound him with heavy chains
and thrust him into a dark dungeon. But our Lord
appeared to him that same night and comforted him,
&ldquo;moche swetely,&rdquo; so that the warrior took good heart and
feared no torment which he might have to suffer. The
chief magistrate, whose name was Dacien, finding he could
not shake his prisoner&rsquo;s faith by the infliction of torture,
consulted with an enchanter, who agreed to lose his head
should his &ldquo;crafts&rdquo; fail; and taking strong poison, the
wizard mingled it with wine and invoked his gods and
gave it to the Saint, who, making the sign of the cross,
thanked him kindly, and drank it off without injury.
Astonished at the failure of his plan, the magician made
a draught still more venomous, and finding that this also
had no ill effect on the charmed warrior, he himself
acknowledged the might of Christ, embraced St. George&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
knees, and entreated to be made a Christian,&mdash;and his
request was immediately granted.</p>

<p>The provost&rsquo;s fury knew no bounds when he witnessed
these marvels. He stretched the champion on the rack,
but the engine broke in pieces; he plunged him into
boiling lead, and lo! the Saint came out &ldquo;refreshed and
strengthened.&rdquo; When Dacien saw this he began to
moderate his anger, and again had recourse to flattery,
praying the Saint to renounce his faith and sacrifice
to the idols, and, much to his surprise, the knight
questioned him with a smiling countenance why he had
not asked him before, and promised to do his bidding.
Then the provost was glad indeed, and assembled all
the people to see the champion sacrifice. So they
thronged the temple where the Saint was kneeling before
the shrine of Jupiter, but he earnestly prayed a while to
the true God, entreating Him to destroy those accursed
images and convert the deluded Romans,&mdash;&ldquo;and anone
the fyre descended from heuens and brente the temple
and the ydolles and theyr prestes;&rdquo; and immediately
after the earth opened and swallowed up all the ashes.
This last marvel only hardened the ruler&rsquo;s heart and
strengthened him in his infidelity; he caused the warrior
to be brought before him, and sternly reproved him for his
duplicity. &ldquo;Thenne sayd to him Saynt George, &lsquo;Syr,
beleue it not, but come wyth me and see how I shall
sacrefise.&rsquo; Thenne said Dacyan to him, &lsquo;I see wel
thy frawde and thy treachery; thou wylt make the erthe
to swalowe me lyke as thou hast the temple and my
goddes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said St. George, &ldquo;O catiff, tell me how thy
gods help thee when they cannot help themselves?&rdquo;
Then was the provost so enraged that he ran to his wife,
and, telling her that he should die of anger if he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
not master his prisoner, requested her counsel. &ldquo;Cruel
tyrant,&rdquo; replied his loving spouse, &ldquo;instead of plotting
against this heaven-protected knight, I too am resolved
to become a Christian!&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou wilt!&rdquo; returned her
husband furiously, and taking her by her flowing tresses,
he dashed her against the pavement, when, feeling herself
in the agonies of death, she craved of St. George to know
her future lot, seeing she had not been christened.
Then answered the blessed Saint, &ldquo;Doubt thee nothing,
fair daughter, for thou shalt be baptized in thine own
blood.&rdquo; Then began she to worship our Lord Jesus
Christ, and so died and went to heaven. Thither the
martyr followed her very shortly, for Dacien caused
St. George to be beheaded, and &ldquo;so he perished.&rdquo; But
the cruel persecutor did not long survive his victim, for
as he was returning to his palace, says the legend, from
the place of execution, &ldquo;fire came down from heaven
and destroyed him and all his followers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the dragon gave a title in Hungary
to an order of knighthood, that of &ldquo;the dragon overthrown.&rdquo;
This was established in the year 1418, to perpetuate
the memory of the condemnation of John Huss
and Jerome of Prague by the Council of Constance for
heresy, and to denote the overthrow of the doctrines
these men propagated in Hungary, Bohemia, and elsewhere
in Germany, and for which they were ultimately
burnt at the stake. The badge of the order was a
dragon prostrate. In China the dragon is the symbol
of the Imperial power, and all our readers who are
familiar with the appearance of the Celestial pottery,
bronzes, and so forth, will readily recall how commonly
the form is introduced. Some little time ago the Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Government permitted coal-mines to be opened at Kai-ping,
but they were speedily closed again, as it was supposed
that their continued working would release the
earth-dragon, disturb the Manes of the Empress, and
generally bring trouble upon the Imperial house and upon
the nation. Uncharitable people, however, have been
found to declare that the fear of the earth-dragon is all an
excuse, and that, as the Government set its face against
the introduction of railways, so it was equally prepared,
in its rigid conservatism and hatred of innovations, to
forswear the mining operations. The dragon of the
Chinese designers is of the weirdest forms, and conceived
with a freedom and wildness of fancy that puts
to shame our Western attempts, powerful as they often
are.</p>

<p>As a symbol and attribute the dragon is constantly
appearing in medi&aelig;val work, as carvings, illuminations,
and the like, and we may remind our readers that in the
term gargoyle, used in speaking of the strange and
monstrous forms often found in our old cathedrals and
abbeys doing duty as water-shoots, we get the dragon
idea again, as the word is derived from an old French
word signifying some such draconic monster. While,
however, we find ourselves thus classing the dragon
amongst the mythical and arbitrary forms of the stone-carver
or the herald, we must be careful to remember
that its terror had not thus in earlier days lost its sting,
for the workman who sculptured it on a capital or thrust
its hideous form into any other noticeable position not
only regarded it as a symbol, but believed very really
and truly in its veritable existence. Albertus Magnus
gives a long account of the creature, an account altogether
too elaborate for us to here transcribe; but its
capture, according to him, is an easy matter enough if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
one only goes the right way to work. It was fortunately
ascertained that dragons are &ldquo;greatly afraid of thunder,
and the magicians who require dragons for their enchantments
get drums, on which they roll heavily, so that the
noise is mistaken for thunder by the dragons, and they
are vanquished.&rdquo; The thing is simplicity itself, and
rather detracts from the halo of heroism that has hitherto
surrounded dragon vanquishers. A man is scarcely
justified in blowing his trumpet when he has previously
so cowed his antagonist by beating his drum and deluding
its dull brains with his fictitious thunder. Pliny says
that the eyes of a dragon, preserved dry, pulverised and
then made up with honey, cause those who are anointed
therewith to sleep securely from all dread of spirits of
the darkness. In a medi&aelig;val work we are told that
&ldquo;the turning joint in the chine of a dragon doth promise
an easy and favourable access into the presence of great
lords.&rdquo; One can only wonder why this should be, all
clue and thread of connection between the two things
being now so hopelessly lost. We must not however forget
that, smile now as we may at this, there was a time when
our ancestors accepted the statement with the fullest
faith, and many a man who would fain have pleaded his
cause before king or noble bewailed with hearty regret
his want of draconic chine, the &ldquo;turning-point&rdquo; of the
dragon and of his own fortunes. Another valuable
receipt&mdash;&ldquo;Take the taile and head of a dragon, the haire
growing upon the forehead of a lion, with a little of his
marrow also, the froth moreover that a horse fomethe
at the mouth who hath woon the victorie and prize in
running a race, and the nailes besides of a dogs-feete:
bind all these together with a piece of leather made of
a red deers skin, with the sinewes partly of a stag, partly
of a fallow deere, one with another: carry this about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
with you and it will work wonders.&rdquo; It seems almost a
pity that the actual benefits to be derived from the
possession of this compound are not more clearly defined,
as there is no doubt that a considerable amount of
trouble would be involved in getting the various materials
together, and the zeal and ardour of the seeker after this
wonder-working composition would be somewhat damped
by the troublesome and recurring question, Wherefore?
Medi&aelig;val medicine-men surely must have been
somewhat chary of adopting the now familiar legend
&ldquo;Prescriptions accurately dispensed,&rdquo; when the onus of
making up such a mixture could be laid upon them.
John Leo, in his &ldquo;History of Africa&rdquo; says that the dragon
is the progeny of the eagle and wolf. After describing
its appearance, he says&mdash;&ldquo;This monster, albeit I myself
have not seen it yet, the common report of all Africa
affirmeth that there is such a one.&rdquo; Other writers affirm
that the dragon is generated by the great heat of India
or springs from the volcanoes of Ethiopia; and one is
tempted to take the prosaic view that this dragon rearing
and slaying is but a more poetic way of dwelling on
some miasmatic exhalation reduced to harmlessness by
judicious drainage; that the monster that had slain its
thousands was at last subdued by no glittering spear
wielded by knightly or saintly arm, but by the spade of
the navvy and the drain-pipes of the sanitary engineer.
Father Pigafetta in his book declares that &ldquo;Mont Atlas
hath plenty of dragons, grosse of body, slow of motion,
and in byting or touching incurably venomous. In
Congo is a kind of dragons like in biggnesse to rammes
with wings, having long tayles and divers jawes of teeth
of blue and greene, painted like scales, with two feete,
and feede on rawe fleshe.&rdquo; We cannot ourselves help
feeling that if we saw a dragon like in bigness to a ram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
we should so far be disappointed in him. After having
had our imagination filled by legend after legend we
should look for something decidedly bulkier than that,
and should feel that he really was not living up to his
reputation. Abundant illustrations of the most unnatural
history may be found in the works of Aldrovandus: his
voluminous works on animals are very curious and
interesting, and richly illustrated with engravings at least
as quaint in character as the text. His &ldquo;Monstrorum
Historia,&rdquo; published in folio at Bologna in 1642, is a
perfect treasure-house; the various volumes range in
date from 1602 to 1668, and are, with one exception
(Venice), published at either Bologna or Frankfort.
If any of our readers can get an opportunity
of looking through them they will find themselves well
repaid.</p>

<p>Amongst the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum
will be found Aubrey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gentilisme and Judaisme.&rdquo;
His remarks on St. George and the dragon are sufficiently
quaint and interesting to justify insertion here. &ldquo;Dr.
Peter Heylin,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;did write the Historie of
St. George of Cappadocia, which is a very blind business.
When I was of Trin. Coll. there was a sale of
Mr. William Cartright&rsquo;s (poet) books, many whereof I
had: amongst others (I know not how) was Dr. Daniel
Featley&rsquo;s Handmayd to Religion, which was printed
shortly after Dr. Heylin&rsquo;s Hist. aforesaid. In the
Holyday Devotions he speaks of St. George, and asserts
the story to be fabulous, and that there never was any
such man. William Cartright writes in the margent&mdash;For
this assertion was Dr. Featley brought upon
his knees before William Laud, Abp. of Canterbury.
See Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vulgar Errors&rsquo; concerning
St. George, where are good Remarks. He is of opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
that ye picture of St. George was only emblematical.
Methinks ye picture of St. George fighting with ye Dragon
hath some resemblance of St. Michael fighting with the
Devil, who is pourtrayed like a Dragon. Ned Bagshaw
of Chr. Ch. 1652, shewed me somewhere in Nicophorus
Gregoras that ye picture of St. George&rsquo;s horse on a wall
neighed on some occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vast amount of learning upon the subject of our
patron saint may be found in Selden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Titles of
Honour,&rdquo; in which he treats of &ldquo;The chiefest testimonies
concerning St. George in the Western Church,
and a consideration how he came to be taken for the
patron saint of the English nation.&rdquo; Selden originally
inclined to the idea that the saint first stepped into this
exalted position in the reign of Edward III., but in &ldquo;a
most ancient Martyrologie&rdquo; that he afterwards came
across&mdash;one of Saxon date in the library of one of the
Cambridge Colleges&mdash;he found a sufficient testimony
that the position of the saint as patron of Britain dated
from a much earlier time.</p>

<p>Peter Suchenwirt, a German poet of the fourteenth century,
gives in one of his poems a very curious and striking
illustration of the esteem in which at the battle of
Poictiers the English soldiers held their patron saint:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Celtic use of the word dragon for a chieftain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
is curious: in time of danger a sort of dictator was
appointed under the title of pen-dragon. Hence any
of the English knights who slew a chieftain in battle
were dragon vanquishers, and it has been suggested that
the military title was at times confused with that of the
fabulous monster, and that a man thus got an added
credit that did not belong to him. The theory is not,
however, really tenable, as all the veritable dragon-slayers
had the great advantage of living a long time ago, and
no such halo of romance could well have attached itself
to men of comparatively modern times. In any case,
too, the use of the Celtic word is very local, and does not
meet the case of a tithe of the histories of such deeds of
valour. The red dragon was the ensign of Cadwallader,
the last of the British kings. The Tudors claimed
descent from this ancient monarch, and Henry VII.
adopted this device for his standard at the battle of
Bosworth Field. There is a place in Berkshire called
Dragon Hill, near Uffington, and the more famous White
Horse Hill, that is in local legend the scene of the
encounter between St. George and the dragon; and for
full confirmation a bare place is shown on the hillside
where nothing will grow, because there the poisonous
blood of the creature was shed. We learn, however, in
the Saxon annals that Cedric, the West-Saxon monarch,
overthrew and slew here the pen-dragon Naud, with five
thousand of his men. The name of the hill, therefore,
commemorates this ancient victory; but the common
folk of the district, who know nothing of pen-dragons,
erroneously ascribe the battle won there to the more
familiar St. George.</p>

<p>The dragon of Wantley deserves a passing word, since
he supplies a good illustration of how the mythical and the
material are often mixed up. Wantley is merely a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
corruption of Wharncliffe, a delightful spot<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> near Sheffield,
and here, of all places in the world, this very objectionable
dragon took up his abode. One ordinarily expects
to hear of such creatures uncoiling their monstrous
forms in some dense morass or lurking in the dark
recesses of some wide-stretching and gloomy forest;
possibly he may have found the choice of such an
attractive locality may have helped him to an occasional
tourist. On the opposite side of the Don to the crag
that held the cave of the dragon stood the desirable
residence of More Hall; and its owner, doubtless feeling
that the presence of such an objectionable neighbour
was a great depreciation of his property, determined one
day to bring matters to a crisis; so he walked up to the
mouth of the cave clad in a suit of armour thickly covered
with spikes, and administered such a vigorous kick in
the dragon&rsquo;s mouth, the only place where he was vulnerable,
that the whole transaction was over almost at
once, and he was back again in ample time for lunch.
Dr. Percy, the editor of &ldquo;Reliques of Antient English
Poetry,&rdquo; holds that we must not accept this story too
seriously; that, in fact, the old ballad in which it is set
forth is a burlesque, and that the real facts are as follows:&mdash;that
the dragon was an overbearing and rascally lawyer
who had long availed himself of his position and influence
to oppress his poorer neighbours, but he capped a long
series of dishonest and disreputable actions by depriving
three orphan children of an estate to which they were
entitled. A Mr. More generously took up their cause,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
brought all the armoury of the law to bear upon the
spoiler, and completely defeated him, and the thievish
attorney shortly afterwards died of chagrin and vexation.</p>

<p>We sometimes see allusions in poetry and the press
to the sowing of dragons&rsquo; teeth. The reference is always
to some subject of civil strife, to some burning question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
that rouses the people of a state to take up arms against
each other.</p>

<p>The incident is derived from the old classic legend
of the founding of Thebes by Kadmos. Arriving on
the site of the future city, he proposed to make a sacrifice
to the protecting goddess Athene, but on sending his
men to a not far distant fountain for water, they were
attacked and slain by a terrible dragon. Kadmos thereupon
went himself and slew the monster, and at the
command of Athene sowed its teeth in the ground, from
whence immediately sprang a host of armed giants.
These on the instant all turned their arms against each
other, and that too with such fury that all were presently
slain save five. Kadmos invoked the aid of these giants
in the building of the new city, and from these five the
noblest families of Thebes hereafter traced their lineage.
The myth has been the cause of much perplexity to
scholars and antiquaries, but it has been fairly generally
accepted that the slaying of the dragon after it had destroyed
many of the followers of Kadmos indicates the
final reduction of some great natural obstacle, after some
few or more had been first vanquished by it. We may
imagine such an obstacle to colonisation as a river hastily
rising and sweeping all before it in its headlong flood,
or an aguish and fever-breeding morass. The springing-up
of the armed men from the soil has been construed
as signifying that the Thebans in after times regarded
themselves as the original inhabitants of the country&mdash;no
mere interlopers, but sons of the soil from time
immemorial; while their conflicts amongst themselves,
as their city rose to fame, have been too frequently reflected
time after time elsewhere to need any very special
exposition.</p>

<p>Another literary allusion in which the dragon bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
its part is seen in the dragonnades, those religious persecutions
which drove so many thousands of Protestants
out of France during the Middle Ages. Their object
was to root heresy out of the land. Those who were
willing to recant were left in peaceable possession of
their goods, while the others were handed over to the
tender mercies of the soldiery let loose upon them.
These were chiefly dragoons; hence the origin of the term
dragonnade; and these dragoons were so called because
they were armed with a short musket or carbine called a
dragon, while the gun in turn was so called because it
spouted out fire like the dreadful monsters of the legends
were held to do. On many of the early muskets this
idea was emphasised by having the head of a dragon
wrought on the muzzle, the actual flash of the piece on
its discharge issuing from its mouth.</p>

<p>One naturally turns to Shakespeare for an apt illustration
of any conceivable point that may arise. The lover
finds in him his tender sonnets, the lawyer his quillets
of the law, the soldier the glorification of arms, and the
philosopher rich mines of wisdom. The antiquary finds
in him no less a golden wealth of allusion to all the
customs and beliefs of his day. In &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; we find the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Night&rsquo;s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yonder comes Aurora&rsquo;s harbinger.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We get much the same idea again in the line in
&ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Swift, swift you dragons of the night,&rdquo;
and in &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The dragon wing of
night o&rsquo;erspreads the earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Scale of dragon, tooth
of wolf,&rdquo; and many other horrible ingredients are found
in the witches&rsquo; caldron in &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; while in &ldquo;King
Lear&rdquo; we are advised not to come &ldquo;between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
dragon and his wrath.&rdquo; King Richard III. rushes to his
fate with the words, &ldquo;Our ancient word of courage, fair
St. George, inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.&rdquo;
In &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; we find another admirable allusion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though I go alone, like to a lonely dragon that his fen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes feared and talked of more than seen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the play of &ldquo;Pericles&rdquo; we have the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Golden fruit, but dangerous to be touched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death-like dragons here affright thee hard.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And there are other references in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;
and other plays&mdash;references that it is needless here to
give, as enough has been quoted to show our great poet&rsquo;s
realisation of this scaly monster of the marsh and forest.
In the last extract we have given, that from &ldquo;Pericles,&rdquo;
the golden fruit are the apples of the Hesperides, guarded
by the dragon Ladon, foul offspring of Typhon and
Echidna. Allusions to this golden fruit are very common
amongst the poets, so we content ourselves with quoting
as an illustration one that is less well known than many,
from a poem by Robert Greene in the year 1598:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Shew thee the tree, leafed with refin&egrave;d gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon the fearful dragon held his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That watched the garden called Hesperides.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dragon, like the griffin, is oftentimes the fabled
guardian of treasure: we see this not only in the classic
story of the garden of the Hesperides, but more especially
in the tales of Eastern origin. Any of our readers
who have duly gone through much of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights&rsquo; Entertainments&rdquo; will scarcely have failed to
notice the employment of the dragon as a defender of
gold and other hoarded wealth. Guillim, in his quaint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
book on heraldry, says that these treasures are committed
to their charge &ldquo;because of their admirable sharpness
of sight, and for that they are supposed of all other
living things to be the most valiant.&rdquo; He goes on to add
that &ldquo;they are naturally so hot that they cannot be
cooled by drinking of water, but still gape for the air to
refresh them, as appeareth in Jeremiah xiv. 6, where it
saith that the &lsquo;wild asses did stand in the high places,
they snuffed up the wind like dragons.&rsquo;&rdquo; Any one who has
been in any mountainous district in hot weather will no
doubt have noticed the cattle fringing the ridges of the
hills like a row of sentinels. When we first observed
this, and wondered at it, in North Wales, we were at once
told that it was a regular habit of the creatures, that
they did it partly to avoid the plague of flies that haunted
the lower levels and the woodlands, but more especially
to get the benefit of any breeze that might be stirring.
While Guillim is willing to admit that even a dragon
can render valuable service to those who are so fortunate
as to be able to procure his kind offices, and induce him
to play the part of watchdog, he very properly regards
him, and such like monsters, as something decidedly
uncanny. &ldquo;Another sort there is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of exorbitant
Animals much more prodigious than all the former.
Such are those creatures formed, or rather deformed, with
the confused shapes of creatures of different kinds and
qualities. These monsters (saith St. Augustine) cannot
be reckoned amongst those good Creatures that God
created before the transgression of Adam, for those did
God, when He took the survey of them, pronounce to be
<i>valde bona</i>, for they had in them neither excess nor
defect, but were the perfect workmanship of God&rsquo;s
creation. If man had not transgressed the Law of his
Maker this dreadful deformity (in likelihood) had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
happened in the creation of animals which some Philosophers
do call <i>Peccata Natur&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dragon, though, as we have seen, at times induced
to mount guard over other people&rsquo;s property, is ordinarily
a very Ishmaelite; his hand is against everybody, and
everybody&rsquo;s hand against him; yet would he appear, if
we may credit Pliny, to bear an excess and maximum of
ill-will against the elephant. The elephant always strikes
one as being such a great good-natured beast, as one
who could do so much mischief if he would, yet spends
his strength instead for the good of others, that it is
difficult to understand how he should in so pre-eminent
a degree have earned the ill-will of so potent an enemy.
The dragon would appear to be always the aggressor,
and the elephant has to defend himself as well as he
can against the uncalled-for attack: it is satisfactory in
this case to know that the scaly assailant sometimes fully
meets his match. In Book VIII. of Pliny&rsquo;s history we
read that &ldquo;India bringeth forth the biggest elephants, as
also the dragons, that are continually at variance with
them, and evermore fighting, and those of such greatnesse
that they can easily clasp and wind them round
the elephants, and withall tie them fast with a knot.
In this conflict they die, both the one and the other;
the elephant hee falls downe dead as conquered,
and with his great and heavie weight crusheth and
squeaseth the dragon that is wound and wreathed about
him. Also the dragon assaileth him from an high tree,
and launceth himselfe upon him, but the elephant knowing
well enough he is not able to withstand his windings
and knottings about him, seeketh to come close to some
trees or hard rocks, and so for to crush and squeese
the dragon between him and them. The dragons ware
hereof, entangle and snare his feet and legs first with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
their taile; the elephants on the other side undoe those
knots with their trunke as with a hand, but to prevent
that againe, the dragons put in their heads into their
snout, and so stop their wind, and withall fret and gnaw
the tenderest parts that they find there.&rdquo; One does
not quite understand how this last counter-plan of the
dragon is effected, but it is evidently to be understood
as equivalent to &ldquo;checkmate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Bestiare Divin&rdquo; of Guillaume this antagonism
of the elephant and dragon is again referred to, and
indeed we find it an accepted belief throughout the
Middle Ages. Pliny&rsquo;s work was held for centuries in the
greatest admiration, and to add &ldquo;as Pliny saith&rdquo; to any
statement, no matter how wild, was considered amply
sufficient. Guillaume&rsquo;s description of the dragon is as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;C&rsquo;est le plus grand des animaux rampants. Il
nait en &Eacute;thiopie: il a la gueule petit, le corps long et
reluisant comme or fin. C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;ennemie de l&rsquo;&eacute;l&eacute;phant;
c&rsquo;est avec sa queue qu&rsquo;il triomphe de lui: l&agrave; est, en effet,
le principe de sa force; sa gueule ne porte point venin
de mort.&rdquo; The book of Guillaume is a fair type of
several books of the sort written by ecclesiastics during
the Middle Ages. Such books were an attempt to show
that all the works of nature were symbols and teachers
of great Scriptural truths; hence, while much that they
give is interesting, their statements always require to
be received with great caution. If the facts of the case
got at all in the way of a good moral, so much the worse
for the facts; and if a little or a great modification of the
true state of the case could turn a good moral into one
much better, the goodness of the intention was held to
amply justify the departure from the hampering influence
of the real facts. The MS. of Guillaume dates from
the thirteenth century, and is at present preserved in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
National Library in Paris. The writer was a Norman
priest. The work has been very well reproduced in a
French dress by Hippeau, a compatriot of the writer.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
As we simply wish in our extract to bring out the
belief in the antagonism between the elephant and the
dragon, we forbear to add any moral teachings that a
more or less morbid symbolism was able to deduct from
the supposititious fact; but we shall have occasion to
quote again more than once from the &ldquo;Bestiare,&rdquo; and
doubtless the peculiar connection between scientific
error and religious truth will have an opportunity of
making itself felt in one or more of these extracts.</p>

<p>Referring back to the &ldquo;300 Animals,&rdquo; the natural
history that was considered good enough for the people
living in the year of grace 1786, we find, after the
account of the Dart, &ldquo;so called from his flying like an
arrow from the tops of trees and hedges upon men, by
which means he stings and wounds them to death,&rdquo; the
following description:&mdash;&ldquo;The Cockatrice is called the
king of serpents, not from his bigness&mdash;for he is much
inferior in this respect to many serpents&mdash;but because of
his majestic pace, for he does not creep upon the ground,
like other serpents, but goes half upright, for which cause
all other serpents avoid him; and it seems nature designed
him that pre-eminence, by the crown or coronet
upon his head. Writers differ concerning the production
of this animal. Some are of opinion that it is brought
forth of a cock&rsquo;s egg sat upon by a snake or toad, and so
becomes a cockatrice. It is said to be half a foot in
length, the hinder part like a serpent, the fore part like
a cock. Others are of opinion that the cock that
lays the egg sits upon and hatches it himself. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
monsters are bred in Africa and some parts of the world.&rdquo;
In England it would appear, so far as we have observed
the matter, that the hens have entirely usurped the egg-laying
department, and we are therefore spared the
mortification of finding that our hoped-for chick has
assumed the less welcome form of a cockatrice, for we
shall see that the advent of a cockatrice is no laughing
matter. The book goes on to tell us that authors differ
about the bigness of it, for some say it is a span in compass
and half a foot long, while others, with a truer sense
of the marvellous, realise more fully that bulk is a potent
element in all such matters, and at once make it four
feet long. Its poison is so strong that there is no cure
for it, and the air is in such a degree affected by its
presence that no creature can live near it. It kills, we
are assured, not only by its touch, but even the sight of
the cockatrice, like that of the basilisk, is death. We
read, for instance, in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; of &ldquo;the
death-darting eye of cockatrice;&rdquo; and again in &ldquo;King
Richard III.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the
world whose unavoided eye is murtherous;&rdquo; while in
&ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; we find the passage, &ldquo;This will so
fright them both, that they will kill one another by
the look, like cockatrices.&rdquo; After this we can scarcely
wonder at a certain vagueness of description, as those
who never saw the animal have full licence of description,
while those, less fortunate, who have had an opportunity
of studying from the life have forfeited their own in
doing so. The only hope of getting an idea of it would
be the discovery of a dead specimen, for we read that
&ldquo;as all other serpents are afraid of the sight and hissing
of a cockatrice, so is the cockatrice itself very fearful of
a weasel, which after it has eaten rue will set upon and
destroy the cockatrice. Besides this little creature, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
said there is no other animal in the world able to contend
with it.&rdquo; We can well imagine the indignant
astonishment of the cockatrice, after being for years the
monarch of all it surveyed, when the gallant little weasel,
strong in the triple armour which makes a quarrel just,
and duly fortified by the internal application of rue,
charges boldly home and takes him, <i>monstrorum rex</i>,
by the throat. At the time that our authorised version of
the Old Testament was made there was a sufficient belief
in the creature to make the translation of some Hebrew
word seem correctly rendered by the word cockatrice,
for we read in the book of Isaiah that one sign of the
millennial peace shall be that the child shall put his
hand, unharmed, upon the den of the cockatrice; and a
little farther on we find the passage, &ldquo;For out of the
serpent&rsquo;s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his
fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.&rdquo; In the fifty-ninth
chapter the workers of iniquity are described as hatching
the cockatrice egg, and amongst the judgments pronounced
upon the impenitent Jews by the prophet
Jeremiah we find the verse, &ldquo;Behold, I will send serpents,
cockatrices, amongst you, which will not be charmed,
and they shall bite you.&rdquo; The heraldic cockatrice is
represented as having the head and legs of a cock,
a scaly and serpent-like body, and the wings of a
dragon.</p>

<p>Guillim<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in his &ldquo;Heraldry&rdquo; says that &ldquo;the Cockatrice
is called in Latin Regulus, for that he seemeth to be a
little King among Serpents: not in regard of his Quantity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
but in respect of the Infection of his pestiferous and
poisonous Aspect wherewith he poisoneth the Air. Not
unlike those devillish Witches that do work the Destruction
of silly Infants, as also of the Cattel of such their
Neighbours whose prosperous Estate is to them a most
grievous Eye-sore. Of such Virgil in his Bucolicks makes
mention, saying, I know not what wicked Eye hath bewitched
my tender Lambs.&rdquo; The belief in the evil eye
has been almost universal, and may be found in tribes
the most remote from each other either in distance or in
time. If it were not that Guillim is so ostentatiously
loyal, and, like all heralds, a zealous upholder of rank and
state, one might suspect him almost of a touch of bitter
sarcasm in ascribing royal rank to the cockatrice, not
from his magnanimity, not from his noble bearing,
not from his beauty, but from the power of inflicting injuries
that he so especially displays. When we consider
what sort of a sovereign politically, socially, and
every way the second Charles was, Guillim&rsquo;s dedication
of his book to him errs somewhat, perhaps, on
the side of fulsome and sickening adulation:&mdash;&ldquo;To the
most August Charles the Second, King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. Dread
Sovereign, Here is a Firmament of Stars that shine not
without your Benign Beam; you are the Sun of our
Hemisphere that sets a splendour on the Nobility: For
as they are Jewels and Ornaments to your Crown, so they
derive their lustre and value from thence. From your
Breast, as from a Fountain, the young Plants of honour
are cherisht and nurst up. Your vertuous Atcheivements
are their Warrant and Example, and your Bounty the
Guerdon of their Merit. And as all the Roman Emperors
after Julius C&aelig;sar, were desirous to be called Imperatores
and C&aelig;sares after him, so shall all succeeding Princes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
in this our Albion (in emulation of your Vertues) be
ambitious to bear your Name to Posterity.&rdquo;</p>

The reader must notice the near approach to similarity of name in
the Frenchman Guillaume, author of &ldquo;Le Bestiare Divin,&rdquo; and in the
Englishman Guillim, the writer on heraldry, and at the same time make
due discrimination. They are men of widely different periods, and
approach our subject from wholly different directions. <a href="#FNanchor_8_8">Back</a></p>

<p>The Basilisk, to whom also was given the title of king
of the serpents, was another of the stern, very stern
realities of our forefathers, though, like the cockatrice,
it has fallen a victim to the march of intellect. Its royal
rank was bestowed upon it not from its pestiferous
qualities, but from the crest or coronet it wears, or rather
wore, as the species may now be considered extinct.
Like the monstrous kraken of the Norway seas and the
classic harpy or minotaur, down to the sheeted spectre
that clanked its chains last century in churchyard or
corridor, it has failed to make good its claims to our
credence; and even the great sea-serpent, that from time
to time appears in the columns of the newspapers when
Parliament is not sitting, will have to appear very visibly
elsewhere as well, or the scepticism of the nineteenth
century will disestablish it. The basilisk was by some
old writers described as a huge lizard, but in later times
it became a crested serpent. Exact accuracy on this
point was impossible, as, like the cockatrice, the glance
of its eye was death. Pliny says, &ldquo;We come now to the
basiliske, whom all other serpents do flie from and are
afraid of; albeit he killith them with his very breath
and smell that passeth from him: yea, and by report, if
he do but set his eye on a man it is enough to take away
his life.&rdquo; Readers of Shakespeare will recall the passage
in King Henry VI., &ldquo;Come, basilisk, and kill the innocent
gazer with thy sight;&rdquo; and again where the Lady
Anne exclaims to Richard III., with reference to her
eyes, &ldquo;Would that they were basilisk&rsquo;s, to strike thee
dead.&rdquo; Beaumont and Fletcher, too, in their &ldquo;Woman
Hater,&rdquo; speaks of &ldquo;The basilisk&rsquo;s death-doing eye.&rdquo;
Dryden avails himself of the same old belief, and makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
Clytus say to Alexander, &ldquo;Nay, frown not so; you cannot
look me dead;&rdquo; and in another old poem, King&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Art of Love,&rdquo; we find the lines, &ldquo;Like a boar plunging
his tusk in mastiff&rsquo;s gore, or basilisk, when roused, whose
breath, teeth, sting, and eyeballs all are death.&rdquo; The
only way to kill the basilisk was held to be to cause it to
gaze on its own image in a mirror, when its glance would
be as fatal to itself as it had hitherto been to others.
To effect this, however, evidently presents many practical
difficulties, and he must have been a bold man who
ventured on so perilous an errand, where the least
nervousness or mismanagement of the mirror would be
literally fatal in bringing the basilisk to a proper state of
reflection.</p>

<p>The basilisk is mentioned by most of the old writers,
by Dioscorides, by Galen, Pliny, Solinus, &AElig;lian, &AElig;tius,
Avicen, Ardoynus, Grevinus, and many others. Aristotle
makes no mention of it. Scaliger gravely describes one
that was found in Rome in the days of Leo IV., while
Sigonius and others are so far from denying the possibility
of such a beast that they have duly set forth
various kinds or sub-species. Pliny, for instance, describes
a thing he calls the Catoblepas, while &AElig;tius gives
details of another called Dryinus, each being only modifications
of the basilisk idea. Where, of course, the whole
thing was purely a figment of the imagination, the multiplication
of species presents no difficulty at all, and
it really makes little difference whether all the peculiarities
and properties be focussed on one creature, or
whether they be divided by a three or a four, and due
distribution of them made to a like number of slightly
varying monsters. There is no doubt but that if Baron
Munchausen had turned his attention to this branch of
natural history, we should have had many more species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
to record, and some of them probably still more wonderful
than any at present described. The very indefiniteness
of the descriptions gives them an added charm
and affords full scope for romancing. Familiarity is
undoubtedly likely to lead to contempt, and probably if
the Zoological Society of London are ever able to add
a basilisk to their fine collection of reptiles it will be
a very disappointing feature.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nix had what we may be allowed to call a
literary existence amongst the Greeks and Romans, but
scarcely became a visible creation of the artist until the
mythic fowl was accepted by the early Christians as a type
of the resurrection of the body&mdash;an association of ideas
that afterwards rendered its use very common, and Tertullian,
amongst other early writers, thus refers to its symbolic
use. According to a tale narrated to Herodotus on
his visit to Heliopolis, the ph&oelig;nix visited that place once
every 500 years, bringing with it the body of its predecessor,
and burning it with myrrh in the sanctuary of the Sun-god;
but the version on which the Christian moral and
application is based is somewhat different. It is founded
on the old belief that the ph&oelig;nix, when it arrived at the
age of 1461 years, committed itself to the flames that
burst, at the fanning of its wings, from the funeral pyre
that it had itself constructed of costly spices, and
that from its ashes a new ph&oelig;nix arose to life. This
belief, which appears to us so absurd, was for hundreds
of years as accepted a fact as any other point in
natural history. The home of the ph&oelig;nix was said
to be at that delightfully vague address, somewhere in
Arabia.</p>

<p>In Hoole&rsquo;s translation of the &ldquo;Orlando Furioso&rdquo; of
Ariosto we have both the mystic bird and its very
indefinite home thus referred to:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Incense and myrrh perfume her grateful plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Virgin Ph&oelig;nix there in seek of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selects from all the world her balmy nest.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We get the same idea again in Fletcher&rsquo;s poem of
&ldquo;The Purple Island&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So that love bird in fruitful Arabie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When now her strength and waning life decays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon some airy rock or mountain high,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In spicy bed (fix&rsquo;d by near Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; rays),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself and all her crooked age consumes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight from her ashes and those rich perfumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new-born ph&oelig;nix flies, and widow&rsquo;d place resumes.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These two extracts speak respectively of the virgin
and widowed ph&oelig;nix. The latter idea can scarcely
be correct; widowhood implies the loss of a mate,
and the ph&oelig;nix, we are told, is unique and alone
in the world. Pliny and Ovid use the masculine pronoun.
The former writer&rsquo;s account of him, her, or it
will be found in the second chapter of his tenth book,
and runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It is reported that never man was
knowne to see him feeding; that in Arabie hee is held a
sacred bird, dedicated unto the Sunne; that he liveth
six hundred years, and when he groweth old and begins
to decay, he builds himselfe a nest with the twigs
and branches of the cannell or cinnamon and frankincense
trees; and when he hath filled it with all sort of sweet
aromiticall spices, yieldeth up his life thereupon. He
saith, moreover, that of his bones and marrow there
breedeth at first, as it were, a little worme, which afterwards
proveth to bee a pretie bird. And the first thing
that this young ph&oelig;nix doth is to performe the obsequies
of the former ph&oelig;nix late deceased; to translate and
carie away his whole nest into the citie of the Sunne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
near Panch&aelig;, and to bestow it there full devoutly upon
the altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was one of the venerable jokes of our fathers that
a man hearing that a goose would live one hundred
years, determined to buy one and see whether this really
was so; but this simple plan does not seem to have
occurred to any of the ancients, for while Herodotus
affirms that the ph&oelig;nix lives five hundred years, Pliny
as plumply and roundly asserts as a matter beyond doubt
or contradiction that it is six hundred. Another authority,
more precise, though perhaps not more accurate,
brings it, we see, to just one thousand four hundred and
sixty one, the odd unit giving a delightful appearance of
extreme accuracy and precision that seems to challenge
one to gainsay it if he dare.</p>

<p>In Ovid the fable is given with the fullest detail. The
following lines from Dryden&rsquo;s translation let us into the
secret of how the whole thing is managed. &ldquo;Our special
correspondent&rdquo; could hardly be more precise:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ph&oelig;nix was a good deal employed during the
Middle Ages, like the griffin, salamander, and other
mythical creatures, as a badge or heraldic device, one
of the most interesting illustrations being its use by
Jane Seymour. Queen Elizabeth then adopted it, and
thereby gave the court poets a grand opportunity of
yielding her that highly spiced flattery that was so much
to her liking. Sylvester, in his &ldquo;Corona Dedicatoria,&rdquo;
a poem written at a slightly later period, thus introduces
the title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As when the Arabian (only) bird doth burne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her aged body in sweet flames to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her cinders a new bird hath breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom the beauties of the first return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From spicy ashes of the sacred urne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our dead ph&oelig;nix (deere Elizabeth)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new true ph&oelig;nix lively flourisheth.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare frequently employs the ideas associated
with the mythical bird in his writings, and seems to
have thoroughly mastered all that could be said on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
subject. Some half-dozen passages may readily be
quoted as illustrations of this. In &ldquo;As you Like It,&rdquo; for
example, we find the line, &ldquo;She could not love me, were
man as rare as ph&oelig;nix;&rdquo; and the idea of its unique character
is again brought out in &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; in the passage,
&ldquo;If she be furnished with a mind so rare, she is alone the
Arabian bird.&rdquo; The destruction of the bird on its own
funeral pile and the resurrection of its successor therefrom
is several times referred to. In 1 Henry VI. we
read, &ldquo;But from their ashes shall be reared a ph&oelig;nix
that shall make all France afeared;&rdquo; and in 3 Henry VI.,
&ldquo;My ashes, as the ph&oelig;nix, may bring forth a bird that
will revenge upon you all;&rdquo; while as a final example we
may quote the line in Henry VIII., &ldquo;But as, when the
bird of wonder dies, the maiden ph&oelig;nix, her ashes new
create another heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richardson ascribes an age of one thousand years to
the ph&oelig;nix, and adds a detail that many of the older
writers seem to have missed; according to him the
bird has fifty orifices in his bill, and when he has built
his funeral pyre he treats the world to a melodious ditty
through this novel wind instrument, flaps his wings with
an energy that soon sets fire to the pile, and so perishes.
There seems a hint of this vocal and instrumental performance
in &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri&rdquo; where the poet
Moore refers to</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;The enchanted pile of that lonely bird,<br /></span>

<p>The Alchemists employed the ph&oelig;nix as a symbol of
their hopes and vocation, and in Paracelsus and other
writers many curious details of its association with
alchemy may be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
In the annals of Tacitus we find references to what
is termed the ph&oelig;nix period. According to him the
ph&oelig;nix appeared on five occasions in Egypt&mdash;in the
reign of Sesostris, <small>B.C.</small> 866; in the reign of Am-Asis
<small>B.C.</small> 566; in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphos, <small>B.C.</small>
266; in the reign of Tiberius, <small>A.D.</small> 34; and in the reign
of Constantine, <small>A.D.</small> 334. It will seem from this that
the ph&oelig;nix cycle consisted of periods of about 300 years
(another variation from the estimates of Pliny and other
writers quoted). The old monastic writers draw ingenious
parallels between our Saviour and the ph&oelig;nix, both
sacrificing themselves when their career is over, and both
rising again in glory from their temporary resting-place.
The fourth of the dates given above is at once the
alleged date of one of these appearances of the ph&oelig;nix
and also that of the great sacrifice on Calvary.</p>

<p>Though it seems a tremendous drop from the mythical
ph&oelig;nix of Arabia and its dissolution in fragrant spices
to the old Dun Cow in Warwickshire, yet the latter proved
herself, if legends may be credited, a foe fully worthy of
the prowess of a right knightly arm, and as deserving of
our notice as the dragon-slaying of that valiant brother
star of chivalry St. George himself. Sir Guy of Warwick
takes a high place amongst the famous ancient champions,
and Dugdale and other good authorities hold that
the stories connected with his name are not wholly
apocryphal, though doubtless the monks and other early
chroniclers drew the long bow at a venture sometimes.
Dugdale, in his &ldquo;Warwickshire,&rdquo; <small>A.D.</small> 1730, writes&mdash;&ldquo;Of
his particular adventures, lest what I say should be suspected
for fabulous, I will onely instance that combat
betwixt him and the Danish champion, Colebrand, whom
some (to magnifie our noble Guy the more) report to
have been a giant. The storie whereof, however it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
be thought fictitious by some, forasmuch as there be
those that make a question whether there was ever
really such a man, yet those that are more considerate
will neither doubt the one nor the other, inasmuch as
it hath been so usual with our ancient Historians, for
the encouragement of after ages unto bold attempts, to
set forth the exploits of worthy men with the highest
encomiums possible; and therefore, should we be for
that cause so conceited as to explode it, all history of
those times might as well be vilified.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And having
said thus much to encounter with the prejudicate fancies
of some and the wayward opinions of others, I come to
the story.&rdquo; We do not ourselves propose to &ldquo;come to the
story,&rdquo; though it is all duly set down in Dugdale; though
if the fact of Guy&rsquo;s Danish antagonist being a giant could
be fully substantiated, he might perhaps claim a place in
our pages. The date of the combat seems to have been
the year 929. The exploits of Guy were long held in
high favour not only in England but abroad; we find
a French version dated 1525, and the British hero is
referred to in a Spanish romance which was written
almost a hundred years before this. Chaucer evidently
knew the story well, for he tells us that</p>

<p>The origin of the story of the mythical dun cow is lost
in obscurity, but in the north-west of Shropshire will be
found an eminence known locally as the Staple Hill, and
on this a ring of stones of the rude Druidic type seen in
various parts of England, and most notably at Avebury,
in Wiltshire. This circle is some ninety feet or so in
diameter, and legend has it that this enclosure was used
by a giant as a cow-pen. This cow was no ordinary
creature, but yielded her milk miraculously, filling any
vessel that was brought to her. She seems to have
deeply resented the act of an old crone in bringing her
a sieve thus to fill, construed it into a direct insult to
her powers (though one scarcely sees on what ground),
broke loose from her enclosure, and wandered into
Warwickshire, doing enormous mischief, until her career
was cut short by the redoubtable Guy. Bones of the
dun cow may be seen in many places, a circumstance
that is explained by telling us that on the victory of the
knight over the cow he sent its bones far and wide over
the district it had ravaged, as tokens of victory and a
manifest proof that the monster was no longer to be
dreaded. At Warwick a rib is exhibited: this is some
seven feet long, and at Coventry there is a gigantic blade-bone
some eleven feet round. In some cases these probably
are the bones of whales, and in others of the wild
bonasus or urus; but it must be distinctly understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
that they do not give credibility to the legend, but only,
in fact, derive an added glory from being associated with
it. In the fine old church of Chesterfield is another
gigantic rib some seven feet or more in length and a
foot in circumference. This rests on the altar-tomb of
a now unknown knight, whose marble effigy is represented
clothed in a suit of armour, and local tradition
has naturally bestowed on the once nameless warrior
the proud title of Guy, Earl of Warwick. Another big
rib may be seen in the grand church of St. Mary
Redcliff at Bristol. Near it used to be suspended a
grimy old picture representing a fierce-looking dun cow,
and, though the inference was sufficiently obvious, the
sexton, in showing people round, used to boldly affirm
that this undoubtedly was one of the ribs of the monster
slain by Sir Guy. Both rib and picture may now possibly
be removed in deference to more modern ideas, but
they certainly were there within a very recent period.
A third rib may be seen at Caerleon, once a place of
much importance, but now an insignificant little town,
and chiefly interesting from its association with the
history of the great King Arthur. Caerleon boasts a
museum containing a very valuable collection of Roman
and old British relics, and here too is the rib in question.
It has only recently been removed from the
church, and it is, by the way, curious to note the association
of these bones with churches in almost every case.
In the church of Pennant Melangell, in Montgomeryshire,
is another gigantic rib said by some of the natives
to be that of a giant, while others affirm that it is one
of the ribs of St. Monacella, to whom the church is dedicated.
As the bone is over four feet long, her stature
must have been something considerable altogether.
Another big bone is in the church at Mallwyd, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
same county. In Buckland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Curiosities of Natural
History&rdquo; it is stated that &ldquo;the ribs of the dun cow at
Warwick and the gigantic rib at St. Mary&rsquo;s, Bristol, are
the bones of whales;&rdquo; and in his interesting account of
the whale he mentions that he found whale-bones in
all parts of the country, one of them being a large blade-bone
hanging from a ceiling in Seven Dials. Assuming,
as we probably may, that most if not all of these big
bones scattered over the country are those of whales,
one is still at a loss to know how or why they got so
scattered, and more especially why they were placed in
the churches. The legend of the dun cow appears to
afford a very convenient popular explanation of them,
but one feels that there is a mystery that this account
does not dissipate.</p>

<p>The Salamander received its full mythical development
during medi&aelig;val times, though the older writers refer to
it occasionally. We see in the writings of such men as
Pliny the first steps taken towards the erection of that
fabric of fancy and superstition that in the Middle Ages
was reared on so slight a foundation. Pliny asserts that
the Salamander is made in the fashion of a lizard and
marked with spots like stars; that it is never seen during
fair weather, but only in heavy rain; and that it is of
so cold a nature that if it do but touch fire it will as
effectually quench it as if ice were placed thereon. He,
moreover, declares its poisonous nature&mdash;a nature that,
according to later writers, is so noxious that the mere
climbing of the tree by the animal poisons all the fruit, so
that all who afterwards eat thereof perish without remedy,
and that if one enters a river the stream is effectually
poisoned, and all who drink therefrom for an indefinite
date thereafter must die. Glanvil, a learned English Cordelier
monk who lived in the thirteenth century, goes so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
far as to declare roundly, as though undoubted and historic
fact, that 4000 men of the army of Alexander the Great
and 2000 of the beasts of burden were lost through drinking
at a stream that had been thus infected. It was in
the Middle Ages an article of belief that the salamander
was bred and nourished in fire, and we have ourselves
been gravely told that if the fires at the ironworks in the
Midland Counties were not occasionally extinguished, an
uncertain but fearful something would be created in them.
When the salamander is represented it is always placed
in the midst of flames. We see that the book to which
we have already frequently referred as that to which our
grandfathers went for instruction puts the poisonous
nature of the salamander in the following graphic way:&mdash;&ldquo;A
man bit by a salamander should have as many
physicians to cure him as the salamander has spots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The salamander is the well-known device of Francis
I. of France, <small>A.D.</small> 1515-1547, the monarch who met our
own King Henry VIII. at &ldquo;the field of the cloth of
gold.&rdquo; On this occasion the French Guard had the
salamander embroidered on their uniform, and we also
find the device freely in the sculpture, wall paintings, and
stained glass at Fontainebleau, Chambord, Orleans, in fact
in all the palaces of Francis I. The motto adopted
with it was <i>Nutrisco et extinguo</i>, &ldquo;I nourish and extinguish,&rdquo;
a somewhat contradictory saying based on a
somewhat contradictory story, for while we are told on
the one hand that the salamander is reared and nourished
in flame, we are also told that &ldquo;he is of so cold a complexion
that if he doe but touch the fire he will quench it
as presently as if yce were put into it.&rdquo; John, king of
Aragon, had, almost a hundred years before, adopted the
same device, adding to it the motto, <i>Durabo</i>, &ldquo;I will
endure.&rdquo; Asbestos, though really, of course, of a mineral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
nature, was, from its incombustible property, held in the
Middle Ages to be the wool of the salamander. We are
told that the Roman emperors had napkins of this
material, and that if they became at all soiled they were
thrown into the fire, the fierce heat quickly destroying all
foreign matter. As the testing flames purified the good
while they destroyed the bad, so we presume King Francis
intended to hold himself up as a terror to evil-doers and a
rewarder of the loyal and faithful. The motto is none
the less faulty, however; for while we find the king claiming
both functions, it will be noticed in the legend that
it is the fire which nourishes and the creature which
extinguishes.</p>

<p>The writings of Pliny abound in strange ideas; some
of these he evidently set down without putting the statements
to the test, but in many cases he shattered the old
beliefs by bringing them to the crucial test of experiment.
The story of the extreme frigidity of the salamander&rsquo;s
body at once putting out the fiercest fire was a matter
that he thus brought to the testing-point, the result
being that the unfortunate victim of science was quickly
shrivelled up and consumed. Another old statement,
equally capable of being brought to the trial, was that if
even the foot of a man came in contact with the liquid
exuded from the skin of the salamander all his hair
would fall off. Perhaps the reason why one statement
was tested and not the other was that in the first case
any ill consequences that might arise would affect the
reptile, while the second would come home more closely
to the experimenter himself.</p>

<p>In Breydenbach&rsquo;s travels we find a salamander included
amongst the other animals, a position that it probably
owed to its association with legend, for we also find in the
same old author that the unicorn is frankly accepted as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
beast that may be met with by the traveller. The book
is interesting, too, as giving the first figure that had then
been made of a giraffe, or, as he terms it, seraffa.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
existence of the giraffe was long afterwards denied by
naturalists, and his seraffa was for a very lengthened
period held to be but a myth. Breydenbach was a canon
of the cathedral of Mentz, and seems to have been of a
somewhat adventurous spirit, for despite all the difficulties
of the undertaking&mdash;difficulties that in these days of steam-boats,
railways, and through bookings we cannot at all
realise&mdash;we find him visiting Sinai and the Holy Land.
His travels were first printed as a folio volume at Mentz
in 1486. This was a Latin edition; but two years later
we find one in German, and in less than ten years six
different editions were called for in Germany, besides
others printed in Holland and elsewhere for the benefit
of those to whom both Latin and German were unknown
tongues. The book is full of quaint woodcuts,
and is altogether a treasure-house of history, natural and
unnatural.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_11_11">[11]</a></span>
Representations of the giraffe are to be found in the ancient monuments
of Egypt, the animal being part of the annual tribute brought by
the vassal Ethiopians to the king of Egypt. These representations were,
we need scarcely say, unknown to the naturalists of the Middle Ages. <a href="#FNanchor_11_11">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The salamander is commonly to be met with in many
parts of Europe, but the real and the ideal creature are
two very different things&mdash;as different as the deer-eyed
cows quietly ruminating in their verdant pasturage are
to the dun cow that taxed all the heroism of Sir Guy of
Warwick, or as old grey Dobbin to Pegasus. The real
creature is very similar in form to the newts that are so
commonly to be found in ponds, but the salamander of
Francis I. is more like a wingless dragon, while some of
the medi&aelig;val heralds made it a quadruped something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
like a dog. Such a creature, breathing forth flames, may
be seen in the crest of Earl Douglas <small>A.D.</small> 1483.</p>

<p>Shakespearian students will recall how Falstaff rails
at Bardolph, calling him the &ldquo;Knight of the Burning
Lamp,&rdquo; &ldquo;admiral, bearing lantern in the poop,&rdquo; &ldquo;ball of
wildfire,&rdquo; and so forth, all compliments called forth from
the effects of strong liquor on the rubicund countenance
of Bardolph. He winds up by saying, &ldquo;Thou
hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches,
walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern,
but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought
me lights as good cheap, at the dearest chandler&rsquo;s in
Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours
with fire any time this two and thirty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The salamander, like the toad, the slow-worm, or the
water newt, is still held to be decidedly uncanny. In
our younger days our seeking after such small objects of
natural history was always held by wondering rustics as
a foolish tempting of Providence, and we have repeatedly
been told the most moving stories of the poisonous
nature of all such creatures, and especially how newts
developed the most alarming properties if interfered
with, biting out pieces of the captor&rsquo;s flesh, and then
spitting fire into the wound. Prompt amputation or
death was the dire alternative offered, though in our
own case matters never reached so dread a climax.
&ldquo;Them pisonous effets&rdquo; were many a time in those
by-gone days held in the hand that now guides our pen.
The belief in such fatal powers must have a very
disquieting influence on the rustics who hold it.
When farm animals, as calves or colts, die mysteriously,
some one is sure to start the theory that they have
been bitten by an effet while drinking; and in view of
such a belief even the fetching of a pail of water from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
the pond that too often supplies the drinking water in
country places must appear attended with no little risk.
The following graphic and amusing letter from one
of the correspondents of the <i>Field</i> newspaper shows how
the salamander is still regarded in rural France:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Returning homeward a few evenings ago from a
country walk in the environs of D&mdash;&mdash;, I discovered in
my path a strange-looking reptile, which, after regarding
me steadfastly for a few moments, walked slowly to the
side of the road, and commenced very deliberately
clambering up the wall. Never having seen a similar
animal, I was rather doubtful as to its properties; but,
reassured by its tranquil demeanour, I put my pocket-handkerchief
over it, and it suffered itself to be taken
up without resistance, and was thus carried to my
domicile. On arriving <i>chez moi</i>, I opened the basket
to show my captive to the servants, when, to my surprise
and consternation, they set up such a screaming
and hullabaloo that I thought they would have gone
into fits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Oh! la, la, la, la, la!&mdash;Oh! la, la, la, la, la!</em>&rsquo; and
then a succession of screams in altissimo, which woke
up the children and brought out the neighbours to see
what could be the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Oh, monsieur a rapport&eacute; un sourd!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Un sourd!</em>&rsquo; cried one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em class="smallcap">Un sourd!</em>&rsquo; echoed another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;UN S-O-U-R-D!!!&rsquo; cried they all in chorus; and
then followed a succession of shrieks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they calmed down into a mild sample of
hysterics, they began to explain that I had brought
home the most venomous animal in creation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Oh! le vila&iacute;n b&ecirc;te!</em>&rsquo; cried Phyllis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Oh! le m&eacute;chant!</em>&rsquo; chimed in Abigail; &lsquo;he kills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
everybody that comes near him; I have known fifty
people die of his bite, and no remedy in the world can
save them. As soon as they are bitten they <i>gonflent</i>,
<i>gonflent</i>, and keep on swelling till they burst, and are
dead in a quarter of an hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I transferred my curiosity from the basket to a
glass jar, and put a saucer on the top to keep it safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>O Monsieur!</em> don&rsquo;t leave him so; if he puts himself
in a rage, nothing can hold him. He has got such
force that he can jump up to the ceiling; and wherever
he fastens himself he sticks like death.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s all true,&rsquo; cried my landlady, joining the
circle of gapers; &lsquo;<em>Oh! la la! &Ccedil;a me fait peur; &ccedil;a me fait
tr-r-r-r-embler!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Once I saw a man in a haycart try to kill one, and
the <i>b&ecirc;te</i> jumped right off the ground at a bound and
fastened itself on the man&rsquo;s face, when he stood on the
haycart, and nothing could detach it till the man fell
dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ah! c&rsquo;est bien vrai</i>,&rsquo; cried Abigail; &lsquo;they ought to
have fetched a mirror and held it up to the <i>b&ecirc;te</i>, and
then it would have left the man and jumped at its
<i>image</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end of all this commotion was that, while I went to
inquire of a scientific friend whether there was any truth
in these tissue of <i>b&ecirc;tises</i>, the whole household was in an
uproar, <i>tout en &eacute;moi</i>, and they sent for a <i>commissionnaire</i>,
and an ostler with a spade and mattock, and threw out
my poor <i>b&ecirc;te</i> into the road and foully murdered it,
chopping it into a dozen pieces by the light of a stable
lantern; and then they declared that they could sleep
in peace!&mdash;<i>les miserables!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;But there were sundry misgivings as to my fate, and,
as with the Apostle, &lsquo;they looked when I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
swollen or fallen down dead suddenly;&rsquo; and next morning
the maids came stealthily and peeped into my room
to see whether I was alive or dead, and were not a little
surprised that I was not even <i>gonfl&eacute;</i>, or any the worse
for my <i>rencontre</i> with a <i>sourd</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it turned out that my poor little <i>b&ecirc;te</i> that had
caused such a disturbance was nothing more nor less
than a salamander&mdash;a poor, inoffensive, harmless reptile,
declared on competent authority to be noways venomous,
but whose unfortunate appearance and somewhat Satanic
livery have exposed it to obloquy and persecution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the French word <i>sourd</i> primarily means one who is
deaf, we get a curious parallelism of ideas between the
salamander deaf to all sense of pity, and insensible to all
but its own fell purpose, and the old idea of the deafness
of the poisonous adder. &ldquo;Deaf as an adder&rdquo; is a
common country saying, and the passage in the Psalms
of David where we read that &ldquo;the deaf adder stoppeth
her ears, and will not heed the voice of the charmer,
charm he never so wisely,&rdquo; naturally rises to one&rsquo;s mind.
The deafness, it will be noted, is no mere lack of the hearing
faculty, but a wilful turning away from gentle influence.
It was an old belief that when the asp heard the voice
of the serpent-charmer it stopped its ears by burying one
of them in the sand and coiling its folds over the other.</p>

<p>In turning over the quaint pages of the &ldquo;Bestiary&rdquo;
of De Thaun we find allusion made to a creature that
is evidently the salamander again, though we cannot
quite make out the reference to King Solomon. Like
all such books written in the Middle Ages, everything
is introduced to point some moral or religious truth,
though it may at first seem difficult for our readers to
realise what possible connection there can be between the
dreaded &ldquo;sourd&rdquo; and any spiritual instruction. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
reference is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Ylio is a little beast made like
a lizard. Of it says Solomon that in a king&rsquo;s house it
ought to be and to frequent, to give an example. It is
of such nature that if it come by chance where there
shall be burning fire it will immediately extinguish it.
The beast is so cold and of such a quality that fire will
not be able to burn where it shall enter, nor will trouble
happen in the place where it shall be. A beast of such
quality signifies such men as was Ananias, as was Azarias,
and as was Misael, who served God fairly: these three
issued from the fire praising God. He who has faith
only will never have hurt from fire.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Like the salamander, the Griffin was to our forefathers
no mere creature of the imagination. Ctesias describes
them in all sober earnestness as &ldquo;birds with four feet,
of the size of a wolf, and having the legs and claws of
a lion. Their feathers are red on the breast and black
on the rest of the body.&rdquo; Glanvil says of them, &ldquo;The
claws of a griffin are so large and ample that he can
seize an armed man as easily by the body as a hawk a
little bird. In like manner he can carry off a horse or
an ox, or any other beast in his flight.&rdquo; The creature is,
if anything, still more terrible when met with in the
description given by Sir John Mandeville:&mdash;&ldquo;Thai have
the body upward as an egle, and benethe as a lyoun,
but a griffonne hath the body more gret, and is more
strong than eight lyouns, and more grete and strongere
than an hundred egles such as we have among us. For
he hath his talouns so large and so longe and grete upon
his fete as though thei weren homes of grete oxen, so
that men maken cuppes of them to drinken of.&rdquo; Oriental
writers, who appear to have an especial delight in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
marvellous, go even beyond this, and the creature becomes
with them the roc, the terrible creature we read of, for
example, in the wonderful adventures of &ldquo;Sindbad the
Sailor.&rdquo; Milton introduces the creature very finely in
his noble poem, as for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As when a gryphon through the wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wing&egrave;d course o&rsquo;er hill and moory dale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has from his watchful custody purloin&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guarded gold: so eagerly the fiend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&rsquo;er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Arimaspians were a one-eyed people of Scythia,
who braided their hair with gold and drew their supplies
of the precious metal as best they could from the stores
guarded by the griffins. The griffin has long been employed
as a symbol of watchfulness, courage, and perseverance,
on account of this fabled treasure-guarding.
But Browne, who, as we have seen, took great delight in
vivisecting the vulgar errors of his day and generation,
discourses as follows on the matter&mdash;&ldquo;Aristeus affirmed
that neer the Arimaspi, or one-eyed nation, griffins
defended the mines of gold, but this, as Herodotus
delivereth, he wrote from hearsay, and Michovius, who
hath expressly written of those parts, plainly affirmeth
that there is neither gold nor griffins in that country, nor
any such Animall extant, for so doth he conclude, &lsquo;Ego
vero contra veteres authores, gryphes nec in illa septentrionis
nec in alius orbis partibus inveniri affirmarim.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like the dragon, the griffin seems to have been a
good sort of fellow to deal with if you only took him the
right way, and though a terrible monster to encounter
if one had any burglarious intentions, he seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
served his masters with a singleness of purpose and
bull-dog tenacity that were very much to his credit.
In Ariosto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orlando Furioso&rdquo; we read of a griffin-steed
that flew through the air with its master on its
back, and landed him wheresoever he listed.</p>

<p>The griffin was fabled to be the offspring of the union
of the lion and the eagle; it has the leonine body and
stout claws of one parent, the hooked beak, keen eye,
and wings of the other. The form is very often met
with in heraldry, past and present, either as a crest or
as a supporter to the arms. A very familiar example
of their employment in this latter service will be seen
in the arms of the city of London. It is also a very
common form in Roman and Renaissance painting
and sculpture. Gryphius, a celebrated French printer,
adopted the creature as his device, and on his decease
the following epitaph was written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;La grande griffe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui tout griffe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A griff&eacute; le corps de Gryphe.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though ordinarily written as griffin or griffon, the
alternative rendering gryphon is somewhat more correct,
as the word is derived from the Greek <i>grypos</i>, or hook-nosed,
in evident allusion to its eagle-beak. Shakespeare
frequently refers to the creature, but the only instance
we need here refer to is where a considerable difference
in the spelling of the word might lead some of our
readers astray. The passage to which we allude will be
found in &ldquo;The Rape of Lucrece,&rdquo; where she</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Like a white hind under the grype&rsquo;s sharp claws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleads in a wilderness, where are no laws.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the forests of Bohemia, we are told by Burton in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
his &ldquo;Miracles of Art and Nature,&rdquo; there is a little beast
called the Lomie, &ldquo;which hath hanging under its neck
a bladder always full of scalding water, with which, when
she is hunted, she so tortureth the dogs that she thereby
easily makes her escape.&rdquo; Elsewhere he tells of four-footed
serpents, strange creatures that, unlike many of
his wonders&mdash;only to be found in Peru or India, or such
like distant lands&mdash;are to be seen as near home as
Poland. The people of Poland, we are told, are &ldquo;boysterous,
rude, and barbarous; nourishing amongst them
a kind of four-footed serpent, above three handfuls in
length, which they worship as their household gods,
tending them with fear and reverence when they call
them out to their repasts; and if any mischance do
happen to any of their family it is imputed presently to
some want of due observations of these ugly creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegetable Lambs were another of the wonders of our
forefathers. The credulous Sir John Mandeville says
that in Cathay a gourd-like fruit is found that when ripe
contains &ldquo;as though it were a lytylle lomb withouten
wolle.&rdquo; In the twenty-sixth chapter of his book the
lamb-tree is duly figured, and its peculiar fruit development
graphically delineated. In many old books of natural
history we find representations of some such creature
under the names of the Scythian or Tartarian lamb.
According to some old writers it was said to be purely
an animal, and although rooted to the ground, was held
to have so deadly an effect on vegetation in its neighbourhood
that it effectually prevented the growth of all
herbage within the scope of its baleful influence. So
singular a creature naturally provoked attention and
curiosity, and in the earlier days of the Royal Society
the matter was considered quite worthy of their notice.
Naturally, also, the supply endeavoured to keep pace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
with the demand, and as the belief in mermaids led to
their fabrication and exhibition, so also the myth of the
Scythian lamb took visible shape. One of these impositions
was formerly preserved in the British Museum, not
from any belief in it, of course, but as an illustration of
the old belief.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The reference to the mermaid reminds us that the
sea no less than the land bore in ancient and medi&aelig;val
days its full share of wonders. Of the mermaids we shall
have occasion to say more presently, as we propose to
class together all those forms that are more or less human,
and to deal with them separately; but the sculptures of
classic antiquity or the fancies of the medi&aelig;val herald
afford us illustrations of the sea-horse, the sea-lion, and
many other quaint imaginings. On an antique seal we
once even saw a sea-elephant, a creature having the fore-legs,
tusks, trunk, and great flapping ears of the African
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
elephant, yet terminating in the body of a fish, and duly
furnished with piscine tail and fins. The combination
was of the most outrageous character, and would seem
to indicate the limit possible to absurdity in this direction.
When the ancient writers would desire to people
the vast unknown of air or sea their thoughts naturally
turned to those creatures of the land with which they
were more familiar; hence the denizens of the air or
ocean are not really creations at all, but adaptations,
wings or fins being added to horses, lions, and the like
according to the new element in which they were to
figure. Of these, the sea-horses that draw the chariot of
Neptune through the waves and the winged-horse Pegasus
are examples that at once occur to one&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>Pegasus or Pegasos, the offspring of Medusa and
Poseidon, was the symbol of poetic inspiration. Its
association with Perseus and Bellerophon, with the fountain
of Peirene and the heights of Olympus, may all be
found duly set forth in classic story and engraved or
sculptured on the gems and marbles of antiquity. It is
also introduced in medi&aelig;val heraldry, but there seems to
be no reference in any book of this period to lead us to
suppose that it was then regarded as a living verity.
Shakespeare refers to it from time to time, but in one case
it is only as an inn-sign, and in another the very terms
employed indicate that the reference to it must be taken
in a poetic rather than a literal sense. The first of the
two to which we allude will be found in the &ldquo;Taming of
the Shrew,&rdquo; and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The second will be met with in the first part of &ldquo;King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
Henry IV.;&rdquo; it will probably be very familiar to many of
our readers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm&rsquo;d,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And vaulted with such ease into his seat<br /></span>

<p>The arms of the Barrister Templars of the present day
consist of the Pegasus on an azure shield. The original
devices of the Templars were the Agnus Dei, a device
that may still be seen carved on the Temple buildings in
London, and two knights riding one behind the other
on the same horse. This badge or device was originally
chosen to denote the poverty of the order in its earlier
days, but at a later day, when the symbol was misunderstood,
these two rude figures of knights were taken for
wings, and hence we get the modern device of the
winged steed or Pegasus.</p>

<p>The Vampyre was another of the strange imaginings
of our forefathers. It was thought that men and women
sometimes returned, body and soul, from the other world
after their death, and wandered about the earth doing
all kinds of mischief to the living, one of their favourite
pursuits being to suck the blood of those who were
asleep, and these became vampyres in turn. The superstition
took deepest hold in Eastern Europe, and is still
an article of firm faith in Hungary and Servia. One
reads ghastly stories of men unconsciously entertaining
and sheltering vampyres and perishing miserably, of
lonely travellers pining suddenly away, of the bodies of
the dead being disinterred and the corpse found with
the tell-tale stains of blood around its mouth, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
like; and we can easily see how such beliefs as this, or
the wehr-wolf or loup-garou of the Germans and French,
or the ghoul of the Arabs and Persians, would have a
terrible effect on the minds of the superstitious. The
vampyre was a terror of the night, since the corpse then,
after lying in the stillness of the grave throughout the
day, awoke to a fearful vitality. The forms it assumed
were not always human, but were believed to be at times
those of the dog, frog, toad, cat, flea, spider, and many
other innocent creatures. Hence the contemptuous expression
one sometimes hears used to deride a needless
anxiety, &ldquo;a mere flea-bite,&rdquo; could have had no counterpart
in medi&aelig;val days, for the anxiety such a misadventure
might create would be of the most alarming and
harassing description. In old books one finds the most
circumstantial details as to how to detect when one has
been bitten, or to prevent further mischief. To this end
the grave of the suspected vampyre was opened during
daylight when his powers of evil were quiescent, the
corpse was decapitated and the head buried elsewhere,
a stake was driven through the body, and many other
elaborate and horrible precautions were taken to prevent
a recurrence of the nightly resurrection. On the
whole, we may well congratulate ourselves that we do
not live in &ldquo;the good old times.&rdquo; Even now in country
districts and amongst the uneducated one comes across
such striking instances of superstitious belief and thraldom
as suffice to enable us to faintly realise what it must
have been when all alike were enwrapped in a dreadful
bondage to unseen powers of evil far more intense than
is now possible even to the few.</p>

<p>The vampyre bat, a native of South America, is
so called from its blood-sucking propensities. It is the
legend of the vampyre that has given the name to the bat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
not the habits of the bat that originated the fable of the
vampyre, for at the time that these legends of the destroyer
were articles of faith in Europe, the American
animal was quite unknown. The natural tendency
towards exaggeration surrounded the vampyre bat with
a mysterious horror, and having once gained its name of
ill-omen, it became easy to rear upon it a superstructure
of morbid fancy. The researches on the spot of Waterton,
Darwin, and other reliable authorities show that the
name is not altogether ill bestowed, as both Europeans
and natives suffer severely from its attacks during the
night, and the horses and cattle that are out in the
pastures frequently return in the morning with their
flanks covered with blood.</p>

<p>Though the Chameleon, unlike the ph&oelig;nix, the griffin,
or the basilisk, is a living verity, so large a body of fable
has grown up around it that the animal is almost as
mythical as those creatures of the imagination. The
name is derived from two Greek words signifying
&ldquo;ground-lion,&rdquo; a name singularly inappropriate in every
way, as it has nothing leonine in look or nature, while
its organisation fits it especially for living on trees.
When we consider the singularity of its appearance
and the peculiarity of its habits, it is by no means surprising
that it should have attracted attention; and
when we recall the numerous erroneous beliefs current
amongst our rustics in England in this nineteenth
century in the matter of frogs, newts, slow-worms, and
the like, we can hardly wonder at the superstitions that
have surrounded it. The eyes of the creature are quite
expressionless, and are worked perfectly independently
of each other, so that one may be directed upwards and
the other downwards at the same time, or turned simultaneously
to front and rear. Its exceeding slowness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
movement is another curious feature, and though this
exposes them to easy capture when seen, for &ldquo;<i>un
Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on aper&ccedil;u est un Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on perdu</i>,&rdquo; it has its
advantages in another direction, for a creature that takes
some hours to advance a yard or so will certainly not
attract attention by any sudden movement; and the
assimilation in colour of its skin with the surrounding
foliage is another great protection. The creature has
a singular habit of puffing out its body until it is nearly
as large again, and in this state it will sometimes remain
for hours. The best known fact, however, is its capacity
for changing colour, passing from green to violet, blue,
or yellow; but this power of varying the tint has been
greatly exaggerated. We have been told that if the
creature be placed on any colour, as bright scarlet,
it will assume that colour; but this is one of those
fragments of unnatural history that will not bear putting
to the test. The following lines of Prior convey aptly
enough this popular but erroneous notion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As the chameleon, who is known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have no colours of its own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But borrows from his neighbour&rsquo;s hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His white or black, his green or blue.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aristotle was acquainted with the singular motions of
the eyes of the creature, and his description may well
have been taken from nature. At the same time, these
old writers knew nothing of comparative anatomy or
dissection and conducted no scientific <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations; hence in all matters of internal structure
they are often ludicrously in error, while the weakness
of their statements is only perhaps equalled by the
strength with which they are asserted. We are, therefore,
not surprised to read in Aristotle that the chameleon has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
no blood except in its head. Pliny re-states all the errors
made by Aristotle, and further adds that it lives without
either eating or drinking, deriving its nourishment wholly
from the air, and that, though ordinarily harmless, it
becomes terrible during the greatest summer heats.
Even Pliny, however, could not believe everything that
was told him, though his powers of imbibing outrageous
notions were of the keenest, and whenever any old writers
deal with something more than usually incredible they
fortify their statement and evade personal responsibility
by adding &ldquo;as Plinie saith.&rdquo; Pliny, then, rejects the still
older idea that its right leg artfully cooked with certain
herbs conveys the power of invisibility on the eater, and
will not believe that the thigh of its left leg boiled in
sow&rsquo;s milk will induce gout in any one so injudicious
as to bathe their feet in this peculiar broth. Neither
will he credit that a man may be made to incur the hatred
of all his fellow-citizens by having his gate-posts anointed
with another nasty preparation of chameleon. As a set-off
to all this very unusual incredulity he hastens to adopt
the statement of another wise man, Democritus, that it
has the power of attracting to the earth birds of prey, so
that they in turn become the prey of other animals&mdash;a
most unselfish proceeding on the part of the creature, as
its own food consists of flies and such like small matters.
Democritus also asserts, and Pliny confirms him in the
assertion, that if the head and neck of the chameleon be
burned on oak charcoal it will cause thunder and heavy
rain. One is lost in astonishment at the fertility of the
imagination in these old naturalists; and though it is now
easy when one has once been put on the track of
discovery to surmise that the tail of a chameleon burnt
on walnut charcoal might produce snow or possibly
fog, much of the credit of the discovery should go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
the man who first gave the clue to these physiologico-meteorological
influences. Aldrovandus, another man
of science gifted with a strong imagination and the power
of assimilating the fancies of others, informs us that if a
viper passes beneath a tree in the branches of which a
chameleon is resting, the latter will eject from its mouth
a poisonous secretion that effectually rids the world of
the equally venomous snake; and he further adds that
elephants sometimes unknowingly eat a chameleon in
the midst of the foliage on which they are browsing, a
mishap that is rapidly fatal to them unless they can at
once have recourse to the wild olive-tree as a remedy
and antidote.</p>

<p>Many other strange beasts might engage our attention

such familiar creatures as cats and dogs, hares and spiders,
goats and mice, while in another section we must dwell on
the equally unnatural fancies that have been associated
with various plants. Before, however, passing to these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
troglodytes, centaurs, and pigmies, that owe more or less
to the combination of the human with other forms&mdash;a
large class that deserves a measure of attention that may
well suggest the advisability of opening a new chapter
for its benefit.</p>

the fear of Pope&rsquo;s oft-quoted line upon us, &ldquo;The proper
study of mankind is man,&rdquo; we leave for a while these
fantastic imaginings, and turn to another class of forms
scarcely less grotesque, but all agreeing in this, the presence
in them of more or less of the human form and
nature. This class of forms readily subdivides itself
into three sections, which we propose to deal with in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
the order in which we enumerate them. The first of
these are forms compounded of the human and the animal,
as, for example, the sphinx or the centaur; the second
may be considered as human, though distorted, as the
one-eyed cyclops, or, &ldquo;the men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders;&rdquo; while the third class may be
held to embrace the fairies, pigmies, and giants, forms
that are human, yet in bulk or minuteness bear no
semblance to ordinary humanity.</p>

<p>The Sphinx may be considered as more especially an
artistic and symbolic creation, though the old Greek
myth of &OElig;dipos would seem to show that in very early
times there was a real belief in a real monster. The
sphinx is composite in nature, being in Greek art and
legend ordinarily the combination of the head and bust
of a woman with the body of a lion and the wings of
an eagle; while in Egyptian art the creature is always
wingless, and its recumbent leonine body is surmounted
by the head of a man, hawk, or other creature. Egyptian
art is full of such composite monsters, and in cases where
such attributes as the courage of the lion or the wisdom
of the serpent were to be expressed, it was held that the
actual leonine body or the head of the serpent itself would
best convey the required characteristics to the eye and
mind of the beholder. A reference to Wilkinson, Rosellini,
or any other good standard work on Egypt, will reveal
an immense variety of these curious composite figures,
though, as they are evidently in most cases symbolic
merely, they scarcely fall within the limits of our present
study. According to some authorities, the well-known
type of Egyptian sphinx represented the royal power by
its junction in one creation of the highest physical and
mental strength. Pliny, however, states that it is to be
taken as the representation of the beneficent Nile, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
the annual rising took place while the sun was in Leo
and Virgo. As the head is masculine in type, and not
that of maiden fair, this theory will scarcely meet the
case.</p>

<p>The sphinx of classic story, a monster half-woman, half-lion,
was sent by Hera to devastate the land of Thebes
in revenge for an insult that had been offered to her.
Sitting by the roadside, the sphinx put to every passer-by
the celebrated riddle, &ldquo;What creature walks on four legs
in the morning, on two legs at noon, and on three in the
evening?&rdquo; As one after another of these luckless
travellers was obliged to &ldquo;give it up&rdquo; he was cast from
the rock on which the monster sat into a deep abyss at
its foot. The understanding was, that if any one could
solve this conundrum the sphinx should herself perish,
a consummation devoutly to be wished. One &OElig;dipos hit
upon the happy idea that perhaps it was a man that was
meant, his career being traced through crawling infancy
to stalwart manhood, and thence to tottering old age.
Probably the sphinx had presumed too thoroughly on
the badness of the riddle, and thought that its inane
character would be her safeguard in this perilous game
for forfeits. Lord Bacon<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> supplies a curious theory
in explanation of the Greek legend; he tells us that
the creature represented science, her composite nature
being the various and different branches of which it is
composed; that the female face denoted volubility of
speech, while the wings showed the rapidity with which
knowledge could be diffused. Her hooked talons are
supposed to remind us of the arguments of science laying
hold of the mind. Her position on the crag is a hint
that the road to knowledge is steep and difficult, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
the riddles of science &ldquo;perplex and harass the mind.&rdquo;
Probably our readers have already made up their minds
as to the value of this theory of Bacon&rsquo;s; it appears to
us that fifty other equally good explanations might be
devised, and all equally wide of the mark. Of course
after so sweeping a statement we can scarcely be expected
to supply one ourselves for the other forty-nine critics to
mercilessly dissect.</p>

<p>The Chim&aelig;ra was, according to Hesiod, a fire-breathing
monster compounded of lion, goat, and serpent, having
three heads, one of each of these creatures. It is in
this form often represented in classic art; but Coats, a
great authority in blazonry in the last century, in describing
the monster departs somewhat from the ancient
type, and in so doing brings the creature within the scope
of our present chapter. He speaks of it as &ldquo;an imaginary
creature invented by the Poets, and represented by them
as having the Face of a beautiful Maiden, the two Fore-legs
and the Main of a Lyon, the Body like a Goat, the
hinder-legs like a Griffin, and the Tayl like a Serpent or
Dragon turned in a Ring.&rdquo; He does not, however,
give his authorities. Though Milton in his &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; gives us the line, &ldquo;Gorgons, and Hydras, and
Chim&aelig;ras dire,&rdquo; the myth has been received amongst
ourselves with so little faith that anything wildly improbable
is branded as chimerical, and scouted accordingly.</p>

<p>The Centaurs are said by Virgil and Horace to have
dwelt in Thessaly, a land then greatly famed for its breed
of horses. Instances, as in the landing of the Spaniards
in America, have not been unknown where those to whom
the horse was unknown have imagined that the horse
and his rider were but one creature. The belief in centaurs
is not, therefore, so difficult a myth to trace to its origin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
as many others. The usual form of representation is
the conjoining of the body and legs of a horse and the
head, arms, and body of a man so far as the waist,
though in some early works, as, for example, in archaic
pottery in the British Museum, the legs of the man take
the place of the fore-legs of the horse. The celebrated
statue in the Louvre known as the Borghese Centaur, a
sculpture of the most refined period of Greek art, gives
the best idea, perhaps, of the highest treatment the form
permits. Other fine examples, fragments of the sculpture
of the Parthenon, may be seen in our own national collection
in London.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In the works of the earlier writers,
as Homer, the centaurs have nothing unnatural in their
composition; we read nothing of their being half-horse,
half-man, but they are introduced to us as a tribe of men
whose home was in the mountains and whose nature
was altogether barbarous and ferocious. The contests
with centaurs, so favourite a subject in Greek art, have
been generally conceived to be the struggle of Greek
civilisation with the barbarism of the tribes with which
it came in contact in the early Pelasgian period, a
struggle that strangely enough finds its memorial not
only in the grand sculptures of the matchless Parthenon,
but in the delicate beauty of a little English wild flower,
the pink centaury.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Isidore refers to a creature called the Onocentaur,
&ldquo;which has the shape of a man down to the waist, and
behind has the make of an ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the centaurs are frequently represented as bearing
bows and arrows, the Sagittarius of the heralds (such,
for instance, as that assigned as the armorial bearing of
King Stephen or the sign of the Zodiac of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
name) is ordinarily represented in this half-human,
half-equine form, though it is, of course, obvious on a
moment&rsquo;s consideration of the real meaning and derivation
of the word, that this is but a narrow and arbitrary
limitation, and that Robin Hood, for example, or William
Tell, to say nothing of &ldquo;A, the archer that shot at a frog,&rdquo;
might as readily, in fact, be called a Sagittarius as any
Thessalian centaur.</p>

<p>Other partly human, partly animal forms often found
in classic art and literature are those of the Satyrs
and the Fauns. The satyrs are represented as having
bristly hair, ears sharply pointed like those of animals,
low sensual faces, small horns growing out of the top
of the forehead, and a tail like that of a horse or goat.
These satyrs, Greek in their conception, are often
confounded with the fauns of the Romans, creatures
half-man and half-goat, the head, like that of the satyrs,
being horned. Our readers will doubtless recall the
lines in &ldquo;Hamlet:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>These woodland sprites, as attendants on Pan, Bacchus,
and Silenus, are often represented in classic art, and were
a firm article of belief in those early ages. Thorwaldsen
and other modern sculptors have also introduced them in
their work, and they were often a feature in the quaint
processions of the Guilds of the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The Harpys, three in number, were creatures employed,
according to the belief of the Greeks and Romans, by the
higher gods as the instruments for the punishment of the
crimes of men. Their bodies were those of vultures, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
heads those of women, and it was their evil property
to contaminate everything they touched. They are not
infrequently represented in classic art; several examples
of their introduction may be seen on vases in the
British Museum, and notably on some bas-reliefs from
a monument brought from Xanthus, in Lycia, and
commonly, from the subjects of these sculptures, called
the Harpy Tomb&mdash;a monument dating probably from
about the sixth century before the Christian era. Homer
mentions but one harpy, Hesiod gives two, but all later
writers mention three. Milton refers to these creatures
in his &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; Book II., in the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thither by harpy-footed Furies hal&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At certain revolutions all the damn&rsquo;d are brought.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare, too, in his &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing,&rdquo;
Act ii. scene 1, mentions the creature, though in a more
indirect way, using the word, as we from time to time
find it employed elsewhere, as typical of one who wants to
seize on everything and get people into his own power&mdash;&ldquo;a
regular harpy.&rdquo; Another reference will be found in
the third scene in the third act of the &ldquo;Tempest,&rdquo;
where Ariel in the midst of thunder and lightning
enters as a harpy and addresses those before him as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I have made you mad.... I and my fellows
are ministers of fate.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Pericles,&rdquo; again, Act iv.
scene 4, we find Cleon exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<span class="i4">&ldquo;Thou art like the harpy,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
find figured a medi&aelig;val rendering of the creature, and
Guillim in his &ldquo;Heraldry&rdquo; seems to frankly accept the
harpy as a real thing, while the lines he quotes in support
from Virgil are powerfully descriptive:&mdash;</p>

<p>Virgil, it will be noticed, makes the creature wholly
fearful, while Shakespeare makes the horror yet more
weird by giving the implacable and destroying monster
a face of angelic sweetness.</p>

<p>Upton, another old writer on heraldry, says that in
blazoning arms &ldquo;the Harpy should be given to such
persons as have committed Manslaughter, to the End
that by the often view of their Ensigns they might be
moved to bewail the Foulness of their Offence.&rdquo; This
we should imagine, is more simple in theory than in practice,
and Upton must have been very simple himself
to fancy that any one could thus be induced to blazon
their misdoings abroad like that. In the earlier days
of heraldry the monarch had two powerful means of
rewarding or punishing his nobles in what were termed
respectively marks of augmentation and of abatement
in their armorial bearings, but in the later times in
which Upton lived no such compulsory stigma was
possible. We fancy, too, that in the earlier days a good
deal of what a modern judge and jury would call
manslaughter went on, and was not by any means
considered a foul offence to be bewailed over.</p>

<p>The terrible Echidna, half-woman, half-serpent, the
mother of the dread chim&aelig;ra, the fierce dragon of the
Hesperides, the gorgons that turned to stone all who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
gazed on them, the hydra of the Lernean marsh, the
vulture that made itself so decidedly unpleasant to
Prometheus, and several other children of an equally
objectionable type, was another of the monsters once
believed in, while the better known Sirens and Mermaids,
half-woman, half-fish, will naturally occur to the minds
of our readers.</p>

<p>The Sirens were originally nymphs, but Demeter transformed
them into beings half-women, half-birds, for
reasons that may be found duly set forth in any work
on mythology. Ultimately they were again transformed
into creatures of which the upper portion was that of a
beautiful woman, while the lower was fish-like. These
sirens dwelt in the cliffs on the Sicilian shore, and by the
sweetness of their voices bewitched passing travellers,
who, allured by the charms of their song, were drawn to
them, when they were lulled into insensibility and perished.
Skeletons lay thickly round their dwelling, but the warning
was useless and hopeless, as the sirens were allowed
by the gods to retain this cruel power over the hearts of
men until one arose who could defy their sweet allurements.
Orpheus and Odysseus each fulfilled the conditions,
and thus the evil power of the sirens came to an
end. Orpheus, by the unsurpassable sweetness of his
own music and his hymns of praise to the gods, carried
himself and his crew safely past the spot so fatal to others;
while Odysseus stopped the ears of his crew with wax,
that they might be deaf to the bewitching music, while
he himself was bound to the mast, and incapable, therefore,
of yielding to the soft fascination. It has been
surmised that the whole story can be explained by the
soft beating and melodious murmur of the waves over
the hidden shoals and sands that would engulf those who
would attempt to land. However this may be, the sirens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
were at one time a firm article of belief, and are often
represented in ancient art or referred to in ancient
poetry, while later moralists find the simile an apt one
between the siren-song and its tragic effects and all
earthly pleasures that carry within them the seeds of
death.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A later legend of the same type may be seen
in the myth of the Lurlei, a water-spirit whose home was
in the steep cliff that overshadows the Rhine near St.
Goar, the fairness of whose person was as great as the
unfairness of her conduct in luring to their destruction
the passing travellers. Here again, of course, matter-of-fact
people have stepped in and explained all away, a
striking echo and a rock on which to strike being all that
is left to us, the moral being, that if people will be so
foolish as to awaken by bugle or song the slumbering
voices of the rocks when they ought to be giving their
whole attention to their steering, what wonder if they
come to grief? A very good reference to the siren&rsquo;s
lulling song will be found in the second scene in the
third act of the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mermaids and Tritons were once fully accepted facts,
and illustrations of them, literary or artistic, abound,
Ariel in the &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo; sings of the sea-nymphs, and
Oberon in the &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; speaks of</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;A mermaid on a dolphin&rsquo;s back,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To hear the sea-maid&rsquo;s music.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p>Shakespeare seems to have made a very natural error
in confounding the mermaids and the sirens together, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
in the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors&rdquo; his allusion to the one is
in language more adapted to the other:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&ldquo;Her fair sister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ll stop mine ears against the mermaid&rsquo;s song.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another illustration of this will be found in the third
part of King Henry VI., a passage peculiarly appropriate
to our present purpose, as it embodies in a concentrated
form no less than three of the items of unnatural history
we have already dealt with&mdash;the siren&rsquo;s death-dealing
charms, the death-giving glance of the basilisk, and the
changing tints of the chameleon, besides referring to
the hypocritical tears of the crocodile. The passage will
be found in the second scene of the third act, where
Gloster exclaims&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;I can smile, and murther while I smile,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Other references will be found in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and in
&ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the ancients derived their
idea of the mermaid from the Manatees that may be
found on the shores of Africa washed by the Atlantic, or
from the Dugongs of the littoral of the Indian Ocean.
These singular animals have been placed by naturalists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
in a class by themselves and called Sirenia. They have
a curious habit of swimming with their heads and necks
above water. They thus bear some grotesque and remote
resemblance to the human form, and may have given rise
to the poetical tales of mermaids and sirens found in
ancient literature. When the female Dugong is nursing
her offspring the position assumed is almost identical
with that of a human mother. The sea-lions and seals
have the same habit of raising themselves in a semi-erect
position in the water, and the intelligent aspect of their
faces gives them at a little distance a close resemblance to
human beings&mdash;a resemblance often equally striking when
they are seen recumbent on the rocks. It is but little
strange, that early navigators with all the superstitions of
their race, and having a very slight knowledge of natural
history, should be deceived, when we find in Scoresby&rsquo;s
Voyages the incident narrated of the surgeon of his ship
so deceived by one of these creatures that he reported
that &ldquo;he had seen a man with his head just above the
surface of the water.&rdquo; At the same time, it appears to us
at least as probable that the mermaid, like the sea-horses
of Poseidon, was purely a creature of the imagination.</p>

<p>From the graceful beauty of the mermaiden to the less
pleasing physiognomy of &ldquo;Mistress Tannakin Skimker, the
hog-faced gentlewoman,&rdquo; is a great step indeed, yet both
beliefs bear testimony alike to the universal desire after
something wonderful and outside the ordinary course of
nature, a feeling that in its lowest form finds satisfaction
in paying a penny to see a six-legged lamb, while more
cultured minds revel in the wealth of fancy found in the
myths of Hellas. The unhappy lady who has prompted
our present remarks was bewitched at her birth on the
understanding that she should recover her true shape on
being married. She was born, we are told, in 1618 in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
town on &ldquo;the River Rhyne.&rdquo; Our authority, a book dated
the year 1640, gives various facts, but does not say
whether any one was so courageous as to remove the
spell by offering her marriage. The book is embellished
(or otherwise) with a portrait of the luckless Tannakin.
While referring to the one old book our thoughts naturally
turn to another of a similar type, the &ldquo;Humana Physiognomonia&rdquo;
of Porta, a book published in the year 1601.
It is full of curious woodcuts showing the great resemblance
sometimes seen between the features of men and
those of some of the lower animals.</p>

<p>Old Burton tells us, in his &ldquo;Miracles of Art and
Nature&rdquo; (<small>A.D.</small> 1678), of a creature found in Brazil that
had &ldquo;the face of an Ape, the foot of a Lyon, and all the
rest of a Man,&rdquo; and he almost needlessly adds, &ldquo;a Beast
of a most terrible aspect.&rdquo; This is not by any means
the only wonder in that vast and distant land, and he
winds up his description by asserting that &ldquo;it may be
said of Brasill as once of Africk, every day some New
Object of Admiration.&rdquo; In his account of India he tells
us of dog-headed men, while in the Oriental Isles, besides
a river plentifully stored with fish, yet so hot that it scalds
the flesh of any man or beast thrown therein, there are
men with tails.</p>

<p>Numerous other instances might readily be given of
strange combinations of the human form with that of
some animal, but enough has been given as an illustration
of the sort of thing to be freely met with in
ancient and medi&aelig;val history; so we pass to our second
division of humanity&mdash;those who are wholly human, yet
in some way of so marked a departure from the ordinary
type of mankind as to come within the scope of our
strange history. These modifications sometimes arise
from the suppression of some part, as in the case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
headless people; in its exaggeration, as in the instance
of the men of India whose ears sweep the ground as
they walk; or in the multiplication or subtraction of

was that in the headless people:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do grow beneath their shoulders.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the Anthropophagi we may read in Eden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie
of Travayle,&rdquo; a book published in the year 1577. The
word in its literal sense means man-eaters or cannibals.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Eden, in the passage to which we have referred, speaks
of these as &ldquo;the wilde and myschevous people called
Canibales or Caribes, whiche were accustomed to eate
man&rsquo;s fleshe, and called of the old writers Anthropophagi,
molest them exceedingly, invading their countrey, takyng
them captive, kyllying and eatyng them.&rdquo; Our old
author, it will be seen, speaks of still older writers, but
these we have been unable to lay hands on.</p>

<p>Halliwell, in his noble edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Plays, comments on the opinion of Pope and other
writers, that the lines we have quoted from &ldquo;Othello&rdquo;
were perhaps originally the interpolation of the players,
or at best a mere piece of trash admitted to humour
the lower class of the audience. He, as we imagine,
very justly combats this idea, holding that the case was
probably the very reverse of this, and that the poet rather
desired to commend his play to the more curious
and refined amongst his auditors by alluding here to
some of the most extraordinary passages in Sir Walter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Raleigh&rsquo;s account of his celebrated voyage to Guiana in
1595. Nothing excited more universal attention than the
accounts which Raleigh brought from the New World of
the cannibals, headless people, and Amazons. A short
extract of the more wonderful passages was published
in several languages, accompanied by a map of Guiana,
by Jodocus Hondius, a Dutch geographer, and adorned
with copper-plates representing these Anthropophagi,
Amazons, and headless men in different points of view.</p>

<p>Raleigh&rsquo;s book was published in London in 1596, the
year after his return from these wondrous lands. Its
title runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The discoverie of the large,
rich, and bewtiful Empire of Gviana, with a relation of
the great and golden City of Manoa, which the Spaniards
call El Dorado, performed in the year 1595, by Sir W.
Ralegh, Knt.&rdquo; The book is written throughout in a very
fair, honest way, and with an evident desire to gain the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Our
hero shall, however, speak for himself. &ldquo;Next vnto
Armi there are two riuers Atoica and Coara, and on
that braunch which is called Coara are a nation of
people whose heades appeare not aboue their shoulders,
which, though it may be thought a meere fable, yet for
mine owne parte I am resolued it is true, because euery
child in the prouinces of Arromaia and Canuri affirme
the same: they are called Ewaipanoma; they are reported
to haue their eyes in their shoulders, and their
mouths in the middle of their breasts, and that a long
traine of haire groweth backward betwen their shoulders.
The sonne of Topiawari, which I brought with mee
into England, told mee that they are the most mightie
men of all the lande and vse bowes, arrowes, and
clubs thrice as bigge as any of Guiana, or of the
Orenoqueponi, and that one of the Iwarawakeri took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
a prisoner of them the yeare before our arriual there,
and brought him into the borders of Arromaia his
father&rsquo;s countrey. And further, when I seemed to
doubt of it hee told me that it was no wonder among
them, but that they were as great a nation, and as
common, as any other in all the prouinces, and had of
late yeares slaine manie hundreds of his father&rsquo;s people
and of other nations their neighbors, but it was not
my chance to heare of them til I was come away, and
if I had but spoken one word of it while I was there,
I might haue brought one of them with me to put the
matter out of doubt.&rdquo; It appears to us that &ldquo;Sir W.
Ralegh, Knt.,&rdquo; comes out of the matter very much better
than &ldquo;the sonne of Topiawari,&rdquo; who, to say the least of
it, and to take the most charitable view, seems to have
been under a misapprehension of the facts.</p>

<p>The same year saw the publication of a second book,
&ldquo;A relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana, performed
and written in the yeere 1596, by Laurence Keymis,
Gent.&rdquo; This was dedicated to &ldquo;the approved, right
valorous and worthy knight Sir Walter Ralegh,&rdquo; and he
too refers to this mysterious people, though only on the
same terms, information at second hand, not actual
inspection. He says, &ldquo;Our interpreter certified mee of
the headlesse men, and that their mouthes in their
breastes are exceeding wide.&rdquo; He evidently feels that
this is almost as far as he may reasonably expect to
gain credence from the folks at home, for he goes on
to say, &ldquo;What I have heard of a sorte of people more
monstrous I omit to mention, because it is matter of no
difficultie to get one of them, and the report otherwise
will appeare fabulous.&rdquo; He nevertheless does mention
it, for in a note on the margin he says of these people,
&ldquo;They have eminent heades like dogs, and live all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
the day time in the sea: they speake the Charibes
language.&rdquo; Probably these were some kind of seal or
sea-lion, though one does not generally associate with
such creatures the idea of linguistic acquirements. He
does not seem to have found it so easy to get hold of
one of these people as he anticipated; his book at least
gives no hint that he was so far successful. Guiana, like
Africke, was in medi&aelig;val times a land of wonders, and
even Hartsinck, in his work on Guiana, published in 1770,
or not very much more than a century ago, gravely asserts
the existence of a race of negroes in Surinam whose
hands and feet were forked like the claw of a lobster, the
hands consisting merely of a thumb and one broad finger,
like the gloves of one&rsquo;s tender infancy, while the foot
was suggestive of the split hoof of the ox or sheep.</p>

<p>Hackluyt in his &ldquo;Voyages&rdquo; dwells on the land Gaora,
a tract inhabited by a people without heads, having their
eyes in their shoulders and their mouths in their breasts.
His book is dated 1598. A similar race of men, called
Blemmyes, were said to be found in Africa; and Sir
John Maundeville, in his &ldquo;Voiage and Travaile, which
treateth of the way to Hierusalem and of Marvels of
Inde, with other Ilands and Countries,&rdquo; gives an
account of these men whose heads do grow beneath
their shoulders. The book is altogether a most curious
and interesting one, and the quaint illustrations
add greatly to its value. The famous &ldquo;Nuremburg
Chronicle&rdquo; of the year 1493 has a very curious figure
of one of these headless men, almost a hundred years
before they are mentioned by Sir Walter Raleigh, and in
1534 we find another representation in one of the books
of Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Raleigh&rsquo;s book, it will be remembered,
was published in 1596.</p>

An extraordinary realisation of these famous and
fabulous beings was afforded to the people of Stuttgard
at the great Festival held in that city by the Grand-Duke
of Wurtemburg on the occasion of his marriage
with the Margravine of Brandenburg in the year 1609.
The doings of the Festival were illustrated by Balthazar
Kuchlein in a volume of 236 plates. A grand procession
was a marked feature in the rejoicings, and in this
procession we see three of these headless men riding
on gaily caparisoned and prancing steeds, besides
&ldquo;Tempus&rdquo; with his winged hourglass; &ldquo;Labor,&rdquo;
dressed as a rustic, and bearing in one hand a beehive,
and in the other a spade; and &ldquo;Fama,&rdquo; a winged lady-fair
on horseback, and bearing scroll and trumpet. In
this grand but heterogeneous cavalcade we also find,
amongst many others, the counterfeit presentments of
Julius C&aelig;sar, Alexander of Macedon, Hector of Troy,
Diana, Jupiter, Sol, Prudentia, Justicia, Fortitudo, and
Abundancia&mdash;a strange medley, but doubtless a pageant
well pleasing to the burghers of Stuttgard, and to the
countless throngs drawn within their city walls.</p>

<p>Pliny gravely writes of the Fanesii, a tribe in the far
north of Scandinavia, whose ears were so long that they
could cover up their whole body with them; while the
author of &ldquo;Guerino Meschino&rdquo; speaks of Indians with
feet so large that they carried them over their heads as
sunshades. Their means of locomotion must have been,
under these circumstances, decidedly curious.</p>

<p>Amongst one-eyed people we have the Arimaspians
and the Cyclops. The former were a race in Scythia,
and were legendarily supposed to be in constant war
with the gryphons, as elsewhere we find recorded the
continuous hostilities between the pigmies and the cranes.
They are referred to by Milton in his &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
The Cyclops were giants, whose business it was to
forge for Vulcan; their single eye was placed in the
centre of their foreheads. Of these the most notable
was the great giant Polyphemus, the defeated and
blinded foe of Ulysses:&mdash;</p>

<p>All the departures from the ordinary human type that
we have hitherto considered sink into insignificance
when we come to the great Briar&aelig;us, the fifty-headed
and hundred-handed giant, and his companions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;He who brandished in his hundred hands<br /></span>

</div>

<p>Giants of this overwhelming type may be also met
with in the mythology of Scandinavia and India, but
space forbids our dwelling at greater length on their
charms. Having, therefore, so far done homage to the
dictum of Pope, &ldquo;The proper study of mankind is man,&rdquo;
by considering in the first place the combination of the
human nature with the animal, and in the second division
man himself, yet warped and distorted from the image of
God, we now, in the third place, deal with those forms of
human mould that owe their departure from the type
form to an excess of bulk or the reverse&mdash;a class that
includes the men of Lilliput and of Brobdingnag, and
all their fellows in towering height or microscopic
proportion.</p>

<p>The Fairies were held by our ancestors to be a kind of
intermediate beings, partaking of the nature both of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
and spirits. They had material bodies, and yet possessed
the power of rendering themselves invisible at will.
They had minds and hearts that could be touched by
kindly feelings, and at the same time they delighted in
practical jokes of the most pronounced description, while
some displayed a cruel and malignant ferocity. The
general idea, however, of them seems to have been of
a diminutive race possessed with supernatural gifts, animated
with joyous spirits, of great beauty, and full of
kindliness to the sons of men when not crossed or
slighted. We are told, for instance, of an honest farmer
who had been reduced by the badness of the seasons to
poverty, and was about to return homewards one morning
from the fields in despair, having sown what little
seed he had, which was not nearly so much as the
ploughed land required. While pondering, not knowing
what to do, he imagined that he heard a voice behind
him saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Tak&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; gie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As gude to me.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He turned round, and perceived a large sack standing
at the end of the field, and on opening it he found it to
be full of the most excellent seed-oats. Without hesitation
he sowed them; the sample was admirable, and the
harvest no less luxuriant. The man carefully preserved
the sack, and as soon as possible filled it full of the
best grain that his field produced, and set it down on
the spot on which he had received the fairy oats. A
voice called to him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Turn roun&rsquo; your back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whill I get my sack.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The farmer averted his face, and then immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
looked round, but all was gone. Things ever after
prospered with him; for, according to the popular belief&mdash;</p>

<p>In the same dearth, and in the same parish, an old
woman who was nearly perishing of hunger, having
tasted no food for two or three days, was one morning
astonished to find one of her pans full of oatmeal. This
seasonable supply she attributed to some of her benevolent
neighbours, who she imagined had been wishing
to give her a little surprise. Notwithstanding the care,
however, with which she husbanded her meal, it by-and-by
was expended, and she was again almost reduced to
starvation. After passing another day without food her
pan was again replenished, which was regularly done
whenever the supply was exhausted, always allowing her
to remain one day without food. Her store was replenished
so regularly that at last she became careless, and
presumed on the generosity of her invisible benefactors.
One day, on receiving her new supply, she baked the
whole of it into cakes, and having by some means obtained
a little meat, invited all her acquaintances to a
treat. The guests were just going to fall to when, to their
astonishment, they beheld the cakes turn into withered
leaves. After this the store was never renewed.</p>

<p>The origin of the belief in fairies is lost in the mists
of time. Some supposed them to be the spirits of those
who had inhabited the land before the birth of the
Saviour, shut out until the final judgment from the joys
of Paradise, yet undeserving of a place amongst the lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
souls in Hades. Others tell us that they are the Druids
thus transformed because they would not give up their
idolatrous rites, and that they are continually growing
smaller and smaller, until they eventually turn into ants.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
They may be divided into four classes. 1. The white or
good fairies who live above ground, the joyous dancers,
the ethereal beings the poets delight to portray. 2. The
dark or underground spirits, trolds and brownies, a more
irritable race, working in mines and smithies, and doing
good or evil offices in a somewhat arbitrary and uncertain
fashion. 3. The fairy of the homestead, of whom Puck
and Robin Goodfellow are good examples, fond of
cleanliness and order, rewarding and helping the industrious
and punishing the idle and careless. 4. The
water-fairies, the more sombre spirits of the woods
and mountains, the Kelpies and Nixies, luring men to
destruction. We nevertheless find that the fairies of the
sylvan shades interest themselves at times in the affairs
of men, and though it is easy to define four very distinct
classes, we at the same time find that these classes are
blended together a good deal. The whole thing is so
purely a creation of the imagination, not of one mind
but of thousands, that it is impossible to reduce the
subject to mathematical exactness.</p>

Appendix <a href="#appendixo">O</a>. <a href="#FNanchor_24_24">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The fairies of the poets are ordinarily those of the
woodland, while those of the legends of the countryside
are at least equally often the fairies of the homestead in
their association with the daily life, the trivial round, the
common task.</p>

<p>The earliest account of the fairies of England will
be found in the writings of Gervase, in the thirteenth
century, and after that date allusion to them may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
frequently be found; grave chroniclers like Reginald Scot,
poets like Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton,
all make mention of them. The first of these, Scot, in
his &ldquo;Discoverie of Witchcraft,&rdquo; tells us that &ldquo;the faeries
do principally inhabit the mountains and caverns of the
earth, whose nature is to make strange apparitions on
the earth, in meadows or in mountains, being like men
and women, soldiers, kings, and ladies, children, and
horsemen clothed in green.&rdquo; Many unfortunate women
were persecuted as witches during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and their connection with the
fairies was often one of the leading charges against them,
as we may see in the indictment of Alison Pearson;
she was convicted of associating with the fairies, the
definite charge against her being &ldquo;for haunting and
reparing with the Queene of Elfland.&rdquo; Another woman
was found guilty of &ldquo;taking employment from a woman
to speak in her behalf to the Queene of Faerie;&rdquo; and
many other such cases might be brought forward.</p>

<p>Fairies have ordinarily been invisible, and though they
have at times permitted mortals to be present at their
revels, more frequently they would appear to have resented
any intrusion. In Poole&rsquo;s &ldquo;English Parnassus&rdquo;
the most circumstantial details are given: the robes are
of snowy cobweb and silver gossamer; the lamps are the
mystic lights of glowworms; the minstrelry is the music
of the nightingale or the chirp of the cricket. Their
emperor was Oberon, and his royal consort and empress
was the sweet but mischievous Mab:&mdash;</p>

The fairies&mdash;the good people as they were often
called&mdash;were on the whole kindly and beneficent. During
the Middle Ages these little beings had obtained so much
credit that the clergy, who wished to reserve to themselves
the power of blessing or banning, grew seriously
jealous, and endeavoured earnestly to disestablish them
from the hearts of men. That this was by no means
in accordance with the feelings of the laity may be
very well seen in the following extract from the &ldquo;Canterbury
Tales&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

</div>

<p>The fairy rings to be seen in the meadows and woodlands
were accepted with undoubted faith as the
scenes of midnight revelry, and in most cases were
regarded with some little dread from the belief that they
were enchanted ground. Hence when people went to
look after their cattle in the morning they were always
careful to avoid walking too near these rings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Some say the screech-owl, at each midnight hour,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
The effect produced on those who incautiously entered
these charmed circles seems to have been sufficiently
startling, if we may credit the old popular beliefs, to
justify the greatest precautions and the most open-eyed
watchfulness. In some cases the victim of carelessness
or short-sightedness would imagine that he had been
absent but a few minutes with the fairies, when he had
really been away a century or more; while in other cases
a man would suppose that he had lived for a long period
in Elf-land when he had been but away an hour. Probably
in some cases the spirits were alcoholic. We read
of a young man who went out one morning and probably
trod in one of these rings; however that may be, he was
attracted by the especially sweet singing of some unknown
bird. After waiting, as he thought, some few
minutes, he resumed his journey, when he noticed to his
surprise that the fresh and verdant tree in which the
sweet songster had been embowered was scathed and
leafless. The well-known house to which he was going
had disappeared with all its inhabitants, and in its place
a new structure had arisen. On going up to it an old
man, who was evidently the owner, came out and asked
his business, and on learning his name, told him that he
had been away a hundred years or more. &ldquo;I remember
when I was a child hearing my grandfather speak of your
disappearance one day many years before I was born,
and that, after searching for you far and wide, he learned
from a wise woman that you had fallen amongst the
fairies, and that you would only be released when the
sap had ceased to flow in yonder aged tree!&rdquo; He had
scarcely uttered the words when he beheld his long-lost
kinsman fall away to a heap of dry dust!!</p>

<p>A popular Welsh legend tells us that two countrymen
were one night crossing the mountains, when one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
them, thinking he heard some strains of music, lingered
a little behind, and could not afterwards be found. After
fruitless search, his friends learned from a Seer that he
had fallen amongst the fairies, and that the only way to
recover him was to go on the anniversary of his absence
to the place where he had disappeared, and that they must
then pull him out of a fairy ring. Some few bold spirits
were equal to the occasion, and on going to the place at
the stipulated time they discovered their lost relative in
the midst of an immense number of very small people,
who were all dancing round in a circle. They pulled
him out, but he died of exhaustion almost directly, as
he had been dancing without intermission for the twelve
months he had been missing. Another tradition current
in Wales tells us of a young shepherd who peacefully
tended his flock on the steeps of Brynnan Mawr. One
day setting forth as usual at daybreak from his homestead
near the hills, the lofty summit was enveloped in
mist, but, as he proceeded, it gradually cleared away
towards the Pembrokeshire side, a sure sign of a fine
day. Our shepherd felt all the elevation of spirit which
youth and the early dawn of a day in the &ldquo;leafy month
of June&rdquo; might be expected to produce. Whilst trudging
on his way gaily up the steep, he discerned the
extraordinary spectacle of a party of persons, brilliantly
dressed, and in active movement near the summit of the
mountain. He gazed for some time before he could be
convinced that what he saw was real. He climbed
farther and farther, forgetting his sheep and all else in
the world at the apparition of so many bright beings at
that desolate spot. At last he drew very near the party,
whom he was now convinced were either the Fairies, or
some kindred sprites, concluding their nightly revels.
Bursts of gentle music, like the melodious murmuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
of an &AElig;olian harp, ever and anon entranced him with
delight. They were comely little beings to behold, and
seemed very merry, while their habiliments of white, or
green, or red, glistened with more than earthly beauty.
The male sex wore red bonnets, and their fair companions
flaunted in head-dresses outrivalling the gossamer in their
texture; and many either galloped about on tiny white
steeds, or pursued each other with the swiftness of the
breeze. The greater portion of the party, however, were
intently engaged in their favourite sport of dancing in the
circle. Our shepherd did not know how it was, but he
felt an irresistible inclination to make one of this joyous
group, and growing bolder as the actors in the scene
became more familiar to him, he at last ventured forward,
and being encouraged by the friendly signals from all
around, he advanced one step within the ring. The most
exquisite melody now filled the air, and in an instant
all was changed. Brynnan Mawr, with its well-known
scenery, was seen no more. He was suddenly transported
to a gorgeous palace radiant with gold and
precious stones. Groves of odoriferous shrubs, intermingled
with flowers unknown in this world, which
might have rivalled those of the Valley of Gardens in
&ldquo;Lalla Rookh,&rdquo; shed around a fragrance excelling that of
the &ldquo;spicy East.&rdquo; Here did our shepherd wander from
day to day amidst porphyry halls, and pavilions of
pearl. Time sped away, but years seemed insufficient
to explore all the wonders of that veritable Fairyland.
He was attended in his wanderings by kind and gentle
beings, who anticipated every want, and even invented
sports and pastimes to amuse him. In the midst of
the gardens there was a well of the clearest water, filled
with many rainbow-tinted fish. There was but one
limitation affixed to his movements and his curiosity:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
he was forbidden to drink of this well, on pain of having
all his happiness blasted. It might be thought that,
surrounded as he was with all that he could desire, there
would have been no danger of his violating this command,
but the result proved the error of this Utopian
way of viewing the probabilities. One day he cautiously
advanced toward the forbidden spot, and placing his
hand within the well, drew forth some water in his
palm and drank it. The shrieks of many voices instantly
filled the air, all the fair scenes of enchanting
loveliness vanished, and the luckless and too curious shepherd
found himself on the summit of Brynnan Mawr
with his sheep quietly grazing around him in the early
morning just as when he had first entered the fairy-ring.
Though years apparently had passed away while he was
under the magic spell yet it was evident that in reality
not many minutes could have elapsed.</p>

<p>Our readers will doubtless recall Shakespeare&rsquo;s reference
to these &ldquo;fairy rings,&rdquo; in the first scene of the fifth
act in the &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>The flint arrow-heads or celts so dear to antiquaries,
and so commonly to be found in and near the tumuli that
mark the resting-places of our remote ancestors, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
popularly called fairy-darts or elf-bolts. Though the wound of
an elf-bolt was supposed to cause instant death to man
and beast when directed by an aggrieved or mischievous
fairy, the possession of one of these celts secured its
owner from all ill consequences. When cattle or horses
fell lame without the reason being forthcoming, it was
concluded that they had been wounded by these invisible
archers, in which case it was only necessary to touch
the tender place with another elf-bolt or to make
the animal drink the water in which one had been
dipped.</p>

<p>Any money found by the roadside was in the same
way ascribed by our rustics to the fairies, some kindly
spirit having dropped it by the way for the benefit of
the battered wayfarer. As a boy one day in Anglesea
was going out just before daybreak, he saw before him
in the grey and obscure light a party of little beings dancing,
as usual, in a circle. He hastened home in alarm
and without making any further investigation, and on his
return found a groat on a stone. He often saw the
fairies afterwards at the same place, and as regularly
found the money laid for him at the same spot. His
possession of funds awakened the paternal curiosity, and
he at last confessed the whole matter. Ever after this,
though he often passed by the scene of the revels and
scanned the wayside stone intently, he never saw either
fairy frolic or fairy fee again.</p>

<p>Though fairies had the power of making themselves
invisible, and generally resented the intrusion of any
human spectator, they were willing to show themselves
sometimes, it would appear, though frequently the consequences
were not altogether agreeable to the person so
favoured. One evening the curiosity of a countryman,
in his progress homewards, was powerfully excited by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
wild though gentle melody which apparently proceeded
from amidst some rocks, resting in picturesque confusion
on the slopes of the mountain. After listening
for some time he lost his track, and suddenly found
himself close beside a troop of elves, who were dancing
round a mysterious circle of &ldquo;stocks and stones.&rdquo;
Before he had much time for thought the elfin-troop
surrounded him and quickly hurried him aloft, one of
the party first asking the question whether he would
prefer to be conveyed with a high, a moderate, or
a low wind? Had he chosen the first, or &ldquo;above the
wind,&rdquo; he would instantly have soared into the most
elevated regions; but our poor bewildered farmer unwisely
made choice of the low wind, thus rejecting (as
is too often the case in life) the middle course, or
&ldquo;with the wind,&rdquo; where he would have enjoyed an easy
and pleasant aerial excursion. The mischievous little
spirits then hurried him along the surface of the ground,
over bog and briar, thorn and ditch, until at last they
threw him in a most miserable plight head foremost in
the mire.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare&rsquo;s time it was a belief that no one could
see the fairies and live, for he makes Falstaff exclaim,
&ldquo;They are fairies, he who looks on them shall die;&rdquo; but
any one who desires to see them through the eye of a
poet should read most carefully the altogether delightful
&ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo; The temptation to quote
liberally from it is extreme, but its beauty requires it to
be read in its entirety.</p>

<p>The references in that play to changelings reminds us
that we have not yet referred to this notable piece of
family practice.</p>

<p>Both the good and the bad fairies used to recruit their
numbers by carrying off children, or young men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
women. The malignant race delighted in spiriting away
the unbaptized offspring (for it was only over these that
they had any power) of affectionate parents, particularly
when heirs, that they might produce as much mischief
and vexation as possible; while the benignant fairies
never took any recruits but the orphans of pious parents,
who had no protectors, or were oppressed by cruel and
unjust guardians. Such prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, or rather naturalised
fairies, were permitted twice to resume their original
state, and appear to their kindred and acquaintance.
The first time was at the end of seven years, when, if
they had been children when they were taken away, they
appeared to their nearest relatives, and declared to them
their state, whether they were pleased with their condition
as fairies, or wished to be restored to that of men.
If they had been boys or girls when they were removed
from this upper earth, and had by this time grown to
men or women, they always appeared to persons of a
different sex to themselves, with whom they had fallen
in love, to whom they declared their state and passion,
and, according to circumstances, either wished their lover
to accompany them to Fairyland, or suggested to them
a method whereby to recover them out of the hands of
their elfish lords.</p>

<p>The second appearance, at the end of fourteen years,
was for the same purpose, and on this occasion they
were either rescued from the power of the fairies or
confirmed under their dominion for ever.</p>

<p>When the bad fairies carried off a child, they always
left one of their own number in its place. This equivocal
creature was always distinguished by being insatiable for
food, and if kept, seldom failed to draw its supposed
mother into a consumption.</p>

<p>Whenever a family suspected that a child had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
changed for a fairy, they had recourse to the following
strange, but, in the opinion of the country, infallible
ordeal. A sufficient quantity of clay was produced from
the eastern side of a hill, with which all the windows,
doors, and every aperture through the house, excepting
the chimney, were built up. A large fire was then made
of peats, and the supposed fairy, wrapped in the sheets
or blankets of the woman&rsquo;s bed, was laid on the fire when
it was at the briskest, while one of the bystanders
repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Come to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gin mine ye be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gin ye be a fairy wicht,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast and flee till endless nicht.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the child actually was the woman&rsquo;s it instantly rolled
off the fire upon the floor; but, if it was a fairy, it flew
away up the chimney with a tremendous shriek, and was
never more seen, while the real infant was found lying
upon the threshold.</p>

<p>Spenser also refers to this belief in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;And her base elfin breed there for thee left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such men do changelings call, so changed by fairie&rsquo;s theft.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In some parts of the country, it is, or perhaps we should
more correctly say was, customary to protect a child
against fairy influences by tying a red thread round its
throat or by letting its head hang down for awhile in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
early morning. One does not of course see why either
of these remedies should be efficacious against fairies or
against anything else; but any one who has had occasion
to talk matters over with rustics will have found that all
their remedies, whether for ills spiritual or material, are of
the most inconsequent character, and that the gift of
faith in them is one of the most necessary accompaniments.
This belief in fairy changelings is of great
antiquity, for we read in Holingshead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chronicles&rdquo;
that the common people, on the death of King Arthur,
held that he was not really dead at all, &ldquo;but carried
away by fairies into some place, where he would remain
for a time and then return again and reign in as great
authority as ever.&rdquo; It was also an old belief that people
who had once lived with the fairies never again looked
quite like other people, an ingenious way of accounting
for any peculiarity in any one. Sir Walter Scott, in speaking
of elf-possession, says that even &ldquo;full-grown persons,
especially such as in an unlucky hour were doomed to
the execration of parents or of masters, or those who
were found asleep after sunset under a rock or on a green
hill belonging to the fairies, or finally those who unwarily
joined their orgies, were believed to be subject to their
power. The accounts they gave of their situation differ
in some particulars. Sometimes they were represented
as living a life of constant restlessness and wandering by
moonlight. According to others, they inhabited a pleasant
region, where, however, their situation was rendered
horrible by the sacrifice of one or more individuals to the
devil every seventh year. This is the popular reason
assigned for the desire of the fairies to abstract young
children as substitutes for themselves in this dreadful
tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Persons, as we have seen, could occasionally be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
recovered from the fairies, and if changelings were taken
before dark to a place where three rivers met, the stolen
child would be brought back in the night and the fairy
youngster would return whence it came. A poor woman
who once had twins had them adroitly carried away
soon after birth, and two of these elf-changelings substituted.
For some months the change was not suspected,
but as the mother began to perceive that the
children never increased in size her suspicions were
aroused, and she consulted one of the wise men of the
district. This friend in need amply confirmed her suspicions,
and in answer to her appeal for help and counsel,
told her that she must get two eggshells, fill them with
wort and hops, place them where these dubious infants
could see them, and then secretly observe what came
next. After a few minutes of watching the children
began to stir, and these sweet little innocents, who were
supposed to be unable to either walk or talk, crept up
to the table, and after studying the matter awhile, one
said to the other, &ldquo;We were born before the acorn which
produced the oak of which these cottage beams are made,
but this is the first time we ever saw anybody brewing in
an egg-shell!&rdquo; The secret was now fairly out, and the
woman was so exasperated at the trick played on her,
that she fell on the changelings with the greatest fury,
and only desisted when she got a solemn promise that
her own dear children should at once be returned to
her. One egg-shell story leads to another, and in an old
book we came across the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother lived in the immediate neighbourhood
of a farm-house that was positively infested by fairies.
It was one of those old-fashioned houses among the hills
of Cambria, constructed after the manner of ancient
days, when farmers considered the safety and comfort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
their cattle as much us that of their children and
domestics, and the kitchen and cow-house were on the
same floor adjoining each other, with a half-door over,
so that the good man could see the animals from his
chimney-corner without moving. My mother and the
farmer&rsquo;s wife were intimate friends, and she used often
to complain to her that the fairies annoyed her and her
family to that degree that they had no peace;&mdash;that
whenever the family dined, or supped, or ate any meal,
or were together, these mischievous little beings would
assemble in the next apartment. For instance, when
they were sitting in the kitchen, they were at high
gambols in the dairy, or when they were yoking the
cows, they would see the fairies in the kitchen, dancing
and laughing, and provokingly merry. One day, as
there was a great number of reapers partaking of a
harvest-dinner, which was prepared with great care and
nicety by the housewife, they heard music and dancing
and laughing above, and a great shower of dust fell
down, and covered all the victuals which were upon the
table. The pudding in particular was completely spoiled,
and the keen appetites of the party were most grievously
disappointed. Just at this moment of trouble and despair
an old woman entered, who saw the confusion and heard
the whole affair explained. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she in a whisper
to the farmer&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how to get rid of the
fairies. To-morrow morning ask six of the reapers to
dinner, and be sure that you let the fairies hear you ask
them. Then make no more pudding than will go into
an egg-shell, and put it down to boil. It may be a
scanty meal for six hungry reapers, but it will be quite
sufficient to banish the fairies; and if you follow these
directions you will not be troubled with them any more.&rsquo;
She did accordingly, and when the fairies heard that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
pudding for six reapers was boiling in an egg-shell there
was a great noise in the next apartment and an angry
voice called out, &lsquo;We have lived long in this world.
We were born just after the earth was made, and before
an acorn was planted, and yet we never saw a harvest
dinner prepared in an egg-shell. Something must be
wrong in this house, and we will no longer stop under
its roof.&rsquo; From that time the disturbances ceased, and
the fairies were never seen or heard there any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some authorities on the subject&mdash;and there are no
greater authorities on it than the most superstitious old
crones one can lay hold of&mdash;have averred that if any
persons find themselves unwillingly in the company of the
fairies they can cause their instantaneous departure by
drawing out their knives. This acts not as a threat, for
these puny immortals have no need to fear the weapons
of carnal warfare, but from some inherent property in the
cold bright steel.</p>

<p>Many of the fairies are such kindly, genial little souls
that one is rather grieved to find that they are entirely
antagonistic to any religious influence. Many stories
illustrate this unfortunate peculiarity, but to give one
only will suffice. As a village fiddler was returning
home one evening from some festivities that had doubtless
owed much of their success to his enlivening
strains, he was met in the darkness by a stranger. This
stranger wished to make a somewhat curious arrangement
with him, to the effect that on the following night
at midnight he should bring his fiddle to a certain wild
spot on the moorland, while he promised him ample
reward for so doing. Though the fiddler presently
agreed to do so, the more he thought it over the less
he liked the bargain, and he would have gladly thrown
it up had he dared. In his strait he bethought him of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
the minister of the parish, and determined to lay the
whole matter before him and take his advice upon
it. His clerical adviser liked the look of the affair no
better than he did, but he advised him to keep to his
bargain, while he strongly cautioned him to play nothing
but psalm tunes. The fiddler kept his appointment, but
no sooner had the sacred strains arisen than a great
shriek rent the air and he was thrown violently down,
and after receiving no slight castigation from invisible
adversaries he returned home sore and stiff in the early
morning. Unbelievers will no doubt say that the germ
of truth in the story will be found in the fact, that if the
jovial musician so far yielded to the charms of the revels
as to be unable to steer a straight course home within
reasonable hours, the early morning would probably find
him stiff and sore with rheumatism.</p>

<p>The spirits of the mine were as firmly believed in
amongst the miners as the woodland and meadow sprites
were by the dwellers on the country side. They were
generally called knockers, and any sound heard in the
stillness of the earth, that was evidently not the work
of a fellow-toiler, was at once attributed to supernatural
agency. The miners assert that these fairies may be
frequently heard assiduously at work in the remoter
parts, and that by their knocking they draw the attention
of the workmen to the richest veins of ore. In the
&ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; for 1754 we found a curious
letter from a mine-owner, and the extract we give shows
that the belief in such beings was not by any means
confined to the rude and uncultivated miners, men a
great part of whose lives were spent in the bowels of the
earth, far removed from the cheering light of day, and
who were in an especial degree under the influence of
superstition:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
&ldquo;People who know very little of arts or sciences, or
the powers of nature, will laugh at us Cardiganshire
miners, who maintain the existence of knockers in
mines, a kind of good-natured impalpable people, not
to be seen but heard, and who seem to us to work in
the mines; that is to say, they are types or forerunners
of working in mines, as dreams are of some accidents
which happen to us. Before the discovery of the
<i>Esgair y Mwyn</i> mine, these little people worked hard
through day and night, and there are abundance of
sober honest people who have heard them. But after
the discovery of the great mine they were heard no
more. When I began to work at Lwyn Lwyd, they
worked so fresh there for a considerable time, that they
frightened away some young workmen. This was when
they were driving levels, and before we had got any ore,
but when we came to the ore they then gave over, and
I heard no more of them. These are odd assertions,
but they are certainly facts, although we cannot and
do not pretend to account for them. We have now
(October 1754) very good ore at Lwyn Lwyd, where
the knockers were heard to work. But they have now
yielded up the place, and are heard no more. Let who
will laugh; we have the greatest reason to rejoice and
thank the knockers, or rather God, who sends these
notices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the coal districts one meets with a similar belief
in goblin miners. These spirits are ordinarily of a
friendly disposition, and perform such kindly offices for
their human fellow-workers as assisting to pump up
superfluous water or loosening masses of coal. Of
course one can readily see that when the men went
to their work and found their toil diminished, owing
to a heavy fall of coal in the working, superstition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
would at once have material to work on. Some
of these spirits would appear to have been of less
amiable disposition, and the sounds heard were at times
the warnings and forerunners of coming disaster. As
the fairies of the household or of the moonlighted forest
glades were of uncertain and variable natures, though
inclining on the whole to beneficence, so the spirits of
the earth were divisible into those of gentle race and
others of fierce and malevolent disposition. In Milton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Comus&rdquo; we find these earth spirits referred to in the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;No goblin, or swart fairy of the mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath hurtful power o&rsquo;er true virginity;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and in Pope&rsquo;s prefatory letter to the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock&rdquo;
we find a further allusion&mdash;&ldquo;The four elements are inhabitated
by spirits called sylphs, gnomes, nymphs, and
salamanders. The gnomes, or demons of the earth,
delight in mischief; but the sylphs, whose habitation is
in air, are the best-conditioned creatures imaginable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A belief in kindly spirits of the household was
widely spread, for besides our own Robin Goodfellow
we find the Nis of Denmark and Norway, the Kobold
of Germany, the Brownie of Scotland, and many others.
Brownie, we may remark, is a tawny, good-natured spirit,
and derives his name from his colour as distinctive
from fair-ie. Robin Goodfellow was a merry domestic
sprite, full of practical jokes, a terror to the lazy, but a
diligent rewarder of industry:&mdash;</p>

Housewives would see their account in keeping such
a belief vividly before the eyes of their serving-maids,
and may even themselves have sometimes dropped a
tester where their diligent hand-maidens would fancy
it a fairy-reward for their zeal in her service, while the
vague threats of fairy vengeance would come in most
opportunely in support of their own chidings of the careless
and indolent.</p>

<p>We turn, in conclusion, to the fourth class, the evil
spirits of the water and the storm. Of such is the
Cornish Bucca, a weird goblin of the winds, whose
scream was heard amid the roar of the elements as some
gallant vessel was hurled to destruction on the rocks.
In Ireland the same creature was the dreaded Phoca or
Pooka, in Wales the Pwcca, while in Scottish legends
it is the Kelpie. The creature sometimes assumed the
human form, and at others that of the eagle or the horse;
thus in Graham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketches of Perthshire&rdquo; we read&mdash;&ldquo;Every
lake has its kelpie or water-horse, often seen by
the shepherd sitting upon the brow of a rock, dashing
along the surface of the deep, or browsing upon the
pasture on its verge.&rdquo; The Nech is a similar creature
in the folk-lore of Scandinavia. In Wales we meet with
the belief in a creature called Cyoeraeth, so named, we
are told, from its deadly chilling voice. We find it thus
described in an old book:&mdash;&ldquo;The Cyoeraeth is a being in
the dress of a female, with tangled hair, a bloodless and
ghastly countenance, long black teeth, and withered arms
of great length;&rdquo; in short, it is invested with a description
which conveys to the mind the idea of a blasted tree as
compared to the flourishing monarch of the forest, rather
than as possessing the similitude of anything human.
This being (fortunately for the people) seldom made
itself visible, but its scream or shriek at night had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
terrible and overpowering effect on all who heard it. It
generally foreboded death or fearful disaster, and always
occurred when the spirit approached a cross road or
drew near to a river or <i>llyn</i>, when it would commence
to splash and agitate the water with its long bloodless
hands, wailing all the time so as to &lsquo;make night
hideous.&rsquo; Those who heard its dreary moaning (or
thought they did, the case doubtless of the majority)
fled in horror, fearing for their reason, while many were
really affected in mind, and ever after had the shriek
resounding in memory.</p>

<p>In Brecon a romantic gorge called the Cwm Pwcca
bears record in its name of the old belief in the phoca.
As a justification of its title we read the following
story:&mdash;A countryman was wandering in the darkest
of dreary winter nights in vain endeavour to find the
path that would have guided him to his home, when he
saw a light before him on the dreary waste, which he
naturally took for the lantern of some wayfarer. He
quickened his steps and made for it. As he rapidly
neared it he was on the point of hailing its bearer when
the roar of waters smote his ear in the silence of the
night, and, barely arresting his steps in time, he found
himself at the edge of a lofty chasm, the awful gulf at
the base of which the torrent was sweeping with resistless
fury. At this instant the bearer of the lantern took a
flying leap to the opposite side of the gorge, burst into
a scornful and unearthly peal of laughter, and vanished
from the eyes of the affrighted rustic.</p>

<p>The <i>ignis fatuus</i>, will-of-the-wisp, or Jack o&rsquo; lantern was
doubtless at the bottom of such a story as this, and in
Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; we find the following powerful
illustrative passage, referring both to the natural
phenomenon and the myth built upon it:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,<br /></span>

always seem to have been the result of diabolical malice

joked, and the benighted wanderer had little cause to

<p>An old legend tells us how on the advent of Christianity
great Pan and all the woodland deities deserted
their old haunts and were never seen of men again; and
in the same way the march of science and the spread of
education must ere now have killed off all the fairies,
except in the most out-of-the-way districts. Once coaxed
and propitiated, or shudderingly dreaded, they now but
serve to make a pleasant fancy for a Christmas-card, or
aid in the grand spectacular effects of the Christmas
pantomime. Those, then, who would see these denizens
of elf-land and all the grace and beauty that even the
very name of fairy-land suggests, will seek them no longer
in the ferny glades of some fair woodland or beneath the
silvery beams of the moon, but reduce the matter to a
prosaic visit to some great theatre, and endeavour to find
in the great array of &ldquo;supers&rdquo; and the glowing of coloured
fires the realisation of their fair ideal. The fairies are, in
fact, as dead, as hopelessly defunct, as the proverbial
door-nail, which seems to have been accepted by the
wisdom of our ancestors as the most expressive symbol
of mortality and the stern decrees of irreversible Fate.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Pigmies had not the same glamour of romance
about them that was associated with the dwellers in elf-land.
The consideration of them nevertheless comes well
within the same chapter, as, like the fairies, they were a
race of beings of human mould, but differing from the
ordinary standard of humanity by reason of the exceeding
smallness of their stature.</p>

<p>References to them will be found in the writings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Herodotus, Philostratus, Pliny, and many other authors,
the first allusion to them being in the third book of the
Iliad, where the Trojans are compared to cranes fighting
against pigmies:&mdash;</p>

<p>These combats between the pigmies and the cranes
were also dwelt on by Oppian, Juvenal, and others; and
what was, to quote an old writer, &ldquo;only a pleasant figment
in the fountain, became a solemn story in the stream.&rdquo;
Strabo in his Geography considered the belief as fabulous,
and so also did another old writer, Julius Scaliger;
and even Aldrovandus, though ready to accept almost
anything, found a difficulty in crediting it. Albertus
Magnus, another of the old and over-credulous writers,
found as much difficulty as Aldrovandus, but suggested
that probably the belief arose from some big species of
monkey having been taken for a diminutive man. Even
the home of the pigmies was a point quite open to dispute.
Some writers placed them in the extreme north,
where the growth of all nature was feeble and stunted,
while Aristotle placed them at the head of the Nile;
Philostratus affirmed that they were to be found on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
banks of the Ganges, and Pliny placed them in Scythia.
Even their size was open to question, for some would have
us believe that the mounted men in their armies rode
on partridges, while others placed them on the backs of
rams. If the warrior and his steed bore any due proportion
to each other, this seems to point to a considerable
divergence of ideas as to the size of a pigmy. They
were said to have been found by Hercules in the great
desert, and to have assailed him with their bows and
arrows as the Lilliputians did Gulliver. Their valour,
however, in this case seems to have outrun discretion, as
the smiling demi-god carried a number of them off in
his lion&rsquo;s skin. Ctesias says that they were negroes, and
places a kingdom of them in the centre of India. Shakespeare
mentions them, but gives no local habitation.
&ldquo;Will your Grace command me any service to the
world&rsquo;s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to
the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on: I
will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the farthest inch
of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John&rsquo;s foot;
fetch you a hair off the great Cham&rsquo;s beard; do you
any embassage to the Pigmies!&rdquo; Others of our poets
have adopted the myth, though of course without committing
themselves to an expression of their belief in it.
In Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Absalom and Achitophel,&rdquo; for example,
we find the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;A fiery soul, which, working out its way,<br /></span>

<p>Another English writer whose book is before us does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
commit himself to an expression of belief, for his title
runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Gerania, a New Discoverie of a Little
Sort of People called Pygmies, with a Lively Description
of their Stature, Habit, Manners and Customs.&rdquo; The
author was one Joshua Barnes, and his book is dated
1675.</p>

<p>Though spelt indifferently as pigmy and pygmy, the
latter is the more correct, though perhaps a little pedantic-looking;
the word is derived from the Greek name for
them, the Pygmaioi.</p>

<p>Tennant in his work on &ldquo;Ceylon&rdquo; makes the following
very just remark:&mdash;&ldquo;We ought not to be too hasty
in casting ridicule upon the narratives of ancient travellers.
In a geographical point of view they possess great value,
and if sometimes they contain statements which appear
marvellous, the mystery is often explained away by a
more careful and minute inquiry.&rdquo; Against the statements
of the geographers and historians of antiquity
many modern critics have specially delighted to break a
lance, condemning them as more or less fabulous and
untrustworthy, though in some cases, as that of De
Chaillu, the narratives of modern travellers have been
almost as mercilessly analysed.</p>

<p>Probably the African race known at the present time as
Bosjesmen or Bushmen are the modern representatives of
the pigmies, for in their cave-dwelling, reptile-eating, and
other peculiarities they agree entirely with those given by
Pliny, Aristotle, and Herodotus. The tales of the battles
fought with the cranes may have been but a satire on their
diminutive size, or they may very possibly have been the
records of actual facts. The Maori traditions tell of the
contests with the moa and other gigantic birds which
formerly inhabited the islands of New Zealand, while
the Jesuit missionaries give accounts of enormous birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
that were once found in Abyssinia, but are now, like the
dodo, extinct. It is, therefore, quite possible that there
is more truth in the story of these mannikins and their
struggles with their feathered foes than we are at first
prepared to admit, and that while many of the details
of these old fables are evidently imaginative, there was
in more cases than we at once realise a solid foundation
of truth at the bottom of them.</p>

<p>Of giants, the opposite extreme in the scale, we need
say but little. Probably in many cases the early peoples,
who desired to honour their great champions, felt that
the marvels they delighted to credit them with must have
been the work of men of more than human power and
parts. We see much the same feeling in the sculptures
of antiquity, the monuments of Egypt and Assyria, where
the monarch far outweighs even in mere physical bulk
the subjects that surround him. Hence, like Goliath,
the champions of old are generally giants; while at other
times they themselves are of slender frame, striplings
like David, and it is the foes they subdue that are gigantic
in bulk. The struggles, for instance, of the gallant few
against the crying and mighty wrong of human slavery
would have in earlier times been handed down to posterity
as a contest with an evil giant; and in the allegories of
the Middle Ages we meet, in the same way, with Giant
Pope, Giant Pagan, and Giant Despair.</p>

<p>Though in one&rsquo;s earlier years we read the exploits of
Jack the Giant-Killer with great complacency, and give
him full meed of praise for his valour, on fuller reflection
we cannot help seeing that the giants he encountered
had intellects that bore no proportion to their bodily
bulk, and that it was the easiest thing possible to outwit
them; that according to the doctrine which by men of
science is called &ldquo;the survival of the fittest,&rdquo; or in more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
popular parlance &ldquo;the weakest going to the wall,&rdquo; their
destruction was strictly according to the inexorable laws
of nature. While dwarfs have been accredited with a
spiteful vindictiveness that served them in some sort as
a defence, giants have ordinarily been considered as great
good-natured fellows, fully bearing out Bacon&rsquo;s remark
about tall houses being often unfurnished in their upper
story. Perhaps it is a merciful arrangement of nature that
this should be so, for a combination of the maliciousness
of the dwarf with the physical strength of the giant
would be something altogether <i>de trop</i>.</p>

<p>We very early in the Bible narrative meet with references
to giants, but it is by no means agreed by commentators
that the word nephilim thus translated means men
remarkable for their stature. The context in the case of
the first reference to them, for instance, seems to render
it more probable that these were men not of gigantic
stature, but of gigantic wickedness&mdash;men who had departed
from the true religion, and were sustaining their
apostasy by acts of violence and oppression, and endeavouring
by these means to gain to themselves power on
the earth. At the same time in other passages the
references to the size of the couch or the spear clearly
implies their ownership by a man of much more than
the ordinary stature. According to Jewish tradition Og
lived three thousand years, and walked beside the Ark
during the deluge, while after his death one of his bones
was used as a bridge for crossing a river. According to
Moses his bedstead was not quite sixteen feet long, so
that it seems the brook that any single bone would span
could scarcely have required bridging at all; while the
depth at what we may be allowed to term &ldquo;high water&rdquo;
during the Noachic deluge must have been very much
less than all one&rsquo;s preconceived notions would suggest, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
its volume was a thing of indifference to the owner of
this sixteen-feet couch. The nearest approach to a giant
in modern times was an Irishman named Murphy, who
attained to a height of eight feet ten inches. Many of
our readers will remember seeing the Chinese Chang, or
at least hearing of him, as he was exhibited to the curious
in London in 1866 and 1880. His height was eight feet
two inches. Patrick Cotter, an Irishman, who died in
1802, exceeded this by six inches; and one fine youth
named Magrath, an orphan adopted by Bishop Berkeley,
died at the age of twenty, after reaching a height of seven
feet eight inches. There is no absolutely authenticated
instance of any one in modern times reaching nine feet,
though, of course, when tradition and hearsay have taken
the place of the measuring-tape, there is no difficulty in
going considerably beyond that limit. Plutarch tells of
a giant eighty-five feet high, and Pliny of another who
only reached sixty-six. Many of the skeletons of giants
that were then supposed to be found during the Middle
Ages were really the remains of extinct animals. In the
imperfect state of surgical and osteological knowledge,
the leg or blade bone of some gigantic antediluvian
monster was ascribed to some hero of the past, and a
very pretty little giant story promptly built upon it.</p>

<p>Any curious natural phenomena were generally ascribed
by our ancestors to diabolical influence, or else
recognised as the labour of giants. The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway
is a notable and very familiar illustration of this,
and there are few mountains in Wales that are not invested
with some fairy tradition or legend of the marvellous.
Trichrug, in Cardiganshire, which derives its
name from three united hills, is believed to have been
a favourite resort of the giants, and, like Cader Idris, this
lofty elevation was once the special seat or chair of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
giant whose grave is still pointed out. In a match at
quoits which took place here between the giants of
Cambria, he of Trichrug is said to have thrown one
across St. George&rsquo;s Channel to the opposite coast of
Ireland, thus winning the contest triumphantly. His
grave was fabled to possess such extraordinary capabilities
that it not only adapted itself to the size of any one that
lay down in it, but also gifted the individual with greatly
renewed strength. All defensive weapons placed in this
grave were either destroyed or swallowed up. The rocky
fortification, or <i>carnedd</i>, on the summit of Cader Idris is
in like manner invested by the surrounding peasantry
with a mysterious tradition respecting the giant Idris.</p>

<p>The warring of the giants against the rule of Jehovah
finds its parallel in the Greek myth of the sons of
Tartaros and Ge attempting to storm the gate of heaven
and the seat of Zeus, only to meet with signal discomfiture.
The common expression for adding difficulty
to difficulty and embarrassment to embarrassment, the
piling of Pelion on Ossa, refers to this struggle, as the
giants piled two mountains of these names on each
other as a scaling ladder to reach the heights of high
Olympus.</p>

&ldquo;Jacula Prudentum&rdquo; we find the line, &ldquo;A dwarf on
giant shoulders sees further of the two;&rdquo; and in Fuller&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Holy State&rdquo; he says&mdash;&ldquo;Grant them but dwarfs, yet
stand they on giants&rsquo; shoulders and may see the further.&rdquo;
Many other illustrations might, of course, readily be given
of what may be termed the literary existence of giants,
but enough has been quoted to show how valuable
these personages have in poesy and general literature.
In the West &ldquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels&rdquo; and in the East the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainments&rdquo; are two examples
that at once occur to one&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p class="dcap2">WHILE we find numerous extraordinary beliefs
clustering round the so-called natural history
of various birds, such as the legend of the
pelican nourishing its young with its own
blood, or the eagle teaching its offspring to gaze on the
brightness of the mid-day sun, it is curious to note how
little of absolute myth-creation has been developed in
the direction of strange forms of bird life. On the other
hand, many of the weird creations of fancy, such as the
dragon or the phoca, have their terrors greatly enhanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
by the gift to them of the essential bird characteristic,
the power of soaring in mid-air, and thus gaining a great
additional power for evil over their victims. We have
already referred, in our first chapter, to the ph&oelig;nix, and
it now only remains to mention some few other mythical
bird-forms, less widely known, before we pass to other
creations of fancy. Even in heraldry, the home of much
that is marvellous and unnatural, the bird forms depart
but little from natural types, and the only instance to
the contrary that occurs to us is the well-known Martlet,
used not only as &ldquo;a charge&rdquo; in blazonry, but also as a
mark of cadency to distinguish the arms of contemporary
brothers in the same family or to identify different
branches of the same family connection.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

Appendix <a href="#appendixq">Q</a>. <a href="#FNanchor_28_28">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The martlet is very similar in form to a swallow, but
is always represented as without feet, while the French
heralds also deprive it of beak. A good early example
of its use may be seen in the arms of William de Valence,
emblazoned on his shield at Westminster, and dating from
the year 1296; later instances of its employment are so
common that it is hardly worth while to particularise any
special illustration. The martlet, according to Gwillim,
in his elaborate treatise on heraldry, &ldquo;hath leggs exceeding
short, that they can by no means go: and therefore it
seemeth the Grecians do call them <i>Apodes, quasi sine
pedibus</i>; not because they do want feet, but because
they have not such use of their feet as other birds have.
And if perchance they fall upon the ground, they cannot
raise themselves upon their feet as others do, and so
prepare themselves to flight. For this cause they are
accustomed to make their Nests upon Rocks or other high
Places, from whence they may easily take their flight, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
means of the support of the Air. Hereupon it came that
this Bird is painted in Arms without feet: and for this
cause it is also given as a difference of younger Brethren,
to put them in mind to trust to their wings of vertue and
merit to raise themselves, and not to their leggs, having
little Land to set their foot on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In medi&aelig;val days the Bird of Paradise was in like
manner thought to be without feet. The error arose in
a very natural but most prosaic way, and simply sprang
from the fact that the natives who bartered the skins
of the birds with the merchants cut off the legs before
bringing them, naturally thinking that they were of no
value, and that it was for the richness of the plumage
alone that the skins were esteemed. The lovers of the
marvellous in the West built upon this weak foundation
a most poetic superstructure, and believed that
the bird was indeed the denizen of paradise, fed upon
the dew of heaven, incapable of contact with earth,
building no nest, but hatching its eggs in a cavity
upon its own back; ever soaring in the sunlight far
above earth, and independent of all mundane association.</p>

<p>Tavernier supplies another explanation, equally prosaic,
of their footless condition&mdash;one in fact, that entirely
removes the poor birds from all poetic association, and
reduces them to the &ldquo;drunk and incapable&rdquo; state that
some other bipeds are prone to indulge in. He tells us
in his book that the birds of paradise come in flocks
during the nutmeg season to the plantations, and that the
odour so intoxicates them that they fall helplessly to the
earth, and that the ants eat off their feet while they are
thus incapacitated. Moore, in his &ldquo;Lalla Rookh,&rdquo; thus
refers, it will be remembered, to this Tavernier tale in
writing of&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sublime bird which flies always in the air, and
never touches the earth,&rdquo; mentioned by the princess in
the introduction to &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri,&rdquo; was the
Humma, an altogether fabulous creature. Like the bird
of paradise, it was supposed to pass its whole time in the
blue vault of heaven, and to have no contact with earth;
it was regarded as a bird of good omen, and that every
head it overshadowed would in time be encircled with a
crown. The splendidly jewelled bird suspended over the
throne of Tippoo Sultan at Seringapatam was an artistic
embodiment of this poetic fancy, and we can well imagine
that all good courtiers who had any regard for keeping
their necks free from the scimitar would take uncommonly
good care to avoid that prophetic overshadowing, that
would make them the possible rivals and successors of so
very resolute an autocrat.</p>

<p>The Huppe, one of the birds believed in by our forefathers
in medi&aelig;val days, seems morally to have been a
somewhat peculiar and, on the whole, objectionable compound,
reminding one in some degree of those uncomfortable
people who attach an immense importance to
their own belongings, but whose sympathies towards the
members of the clan are scarcely more marked than
their antipathy to all beyond this narrow circle. Such,
at least, is the idea we should gather from the description
of it by De Thaun, for he tells us that &ldquo;when it sees its
father or mother fallen into old age that they cannot see
nor fly, it takes them under its wings and cherishes them.
The huppe has such a nature that if any shall anoint a
man with its blood while he is sleeping, devils will come
and strangle him.&rdquo; The huppe was described as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
like a peacock, but it seems impossible to even imagine
how such a belief in its evil powers could ever have taken
root. It would be difficult to conceive such a notion
growing up in connection with any creature whatever,
but when the first cause is itself non-existent the difficulty
is greatly intensified; one has not even a foothold of fact
as a starting-point. What a picture, again, of cold-blooded
fiendishness does it not open out to us as we see with the
mind&rsquo;s eye the treacherous anointing of some perchance
innocent sleeper with a preparation of <i>Sanguis hupp&aelig;</i> and
then the operator walking off and posing in the eyes of
the world as an honourable burgess, while his accomplices
from the bottomless pit finish the job off for him while
he has gone to Mass or is engaged on &rsquo;Change! It is
worse even than that little affair with the babes in the
wood, bad as that was in many of its details.</p>

<p>The Ibis, beloved as it was by the Egyptians for its
services to them as the destroyer of venomous snakes,
and from its association with the Sacred Nile and the
great deity Thoth, was not altogether allowed to bring
forth its progeny in peace, for it was believed that its
fondness for a serpent diet might so develop in it evil
properties, that its eggs were diligently sought for and
destroyed, lest from them should issue some strange serpentine
forms of horror that in their mysterious nature
would be a still greater scourge than the sufficiently
objectionable grey and brown and diversely spotted and
chequered denizens of the desert that coil or glide
unseen amidst the expanses of burning sand, and whose
fangs convey swift death to those unfortunates who come
within reach of their fatal power.</p>

<p>By far the grandest creation of bird-fancy is the Roc.
This fabulous bird was of enormous size, and of such
strength of talon and digestion that it was said to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
able to carry away an elephant to its mountain home, and
there devour it at a meal; while one old traveller, not to
be outdone in particularity of detail, calculates that one
roc&rsquo;s egg is equal in amount to one hundred and forty-eight
hens&rsquo; eggs. The belief in the roc was altogether
an Eastern weakness, and those who would know more
of it must turn to such romances as that of &ldquo;Sindbad
the Sailor&rdquo; and the narratives of such-like Asiatic
Barons Munchausen. In the Second Voyage of Sindbad
he tells us how he saw in the distance some mysterious
object, which, on closer inspection, proved to be the
egg of a roc. &ldquo;Casting my eyes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;towards
the sea, I could discern only the water and the sky;
but perceiving on the land side something white, I
descended from the tree, and taking with me the remainder
of my provisions, I walked towards the object,
which was so distant that at first I could not distinguish
what it was. As I approached I perceived it to be a
white ball of a prodigious size. I walked round it, to
find whether there was an opening, but could find none;
and it appeared so even that it was impossible to get
up it. The circumference might be about fifty paces.
The sun was then near setting; the air grew suddenly
dark, as if obscured by a thick cloud. I was surprised
at this change, but much more so when I perceived it
to be occasioned by a bird of a most extraordinary size
which was flying towards me. I recollected having
heard sailors speak of a bird called a roc, and I conceived
that the great white ball which had drawn my
attention must be the egg of this bird. I was not mistaken,
for shortly afterwards it alighted upon it and
placed itself to sit upon it.&rdquo; He tells us also in this
same voyage of the furious strife waged between the
rhinoceros and the elephant, a struggle that often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
continues till the roc, hearing the disturbance, swoops
down upon them and seizes them both in his claws and
flies away with them, in much the same manner apparently
as the schoolmaster who, appearing suddenly in the
midst of a fight between two truculent youngsters, chills
their martial ardour by his stony glance, and leads off
each culprit by ear or collar to his den.</p>

<p>In another of Sindbad&rsquo;s sea-ventures, the fifth, we
find an awful warning against trifling with the parental
feelings of the roc. In the course of their voyage the
crew landed on a desert island, and very soon found a
gigantic egg. Sindbad at once recognised what it was,
and earnestly advised them not to meddle with it, but
his remonstrances were unheeded; they boldly attacked
the mass with hatchets, and on finding a young roc
within, cut it into divers pieces and roasted it. These
reckless tars had scarcely finished their meal, when two
immense clouds appeared in the air at a considerable
distance. The captain, knowing by experience what
this portended, or haply making a lucky guess, cried
out that it was the father and mother of the young roc,
and warned all to re-embark as quickly as possible,
and so avoid, if possible, the vengeance of the outraged
owners of the egg. All accordingly scrambled on board,
and sail was set immediately. The two rocs in the
meantime rapidly approached, uttering the most frightful
screams, which they redoubled on finding the state of
their egg, and that their young one was defunct. They
then flew away, and a faint hope began to dawn upon
the mariners that they had not come so badly out of the
business after all, when to their blood-chilling horror the
birds again rapidly approached, each with an enormous
mass of rock in its talons. When they were immediately
over the ship they stopped in mid-air, and one of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
let fall the piece of rock he held. The pilot, his wits
sharpened by the imminent peril the vessel was in, deftly
turned the ship aside, and the great mass plunged into
the depths of the sea alongside; but the other bird, more
fortunate in his aim, let his piece fall so immediately on
the ship that it smashed it into a thousand pieces, and,
with the exception of Sindbad, all the passengers and
crew were either crushed beneath tons of stone or
drowned in the surging billows that such a monstrous
mass created. Lest a suspicion may cross the reader&rsquo;s
mind that the gallant sailor and enterprising merchant
was romancing somewhat when he narrated these stirring
adventures, we hasten to mention that the third calender,
in the same veracious history, met with other experiences
of an equally surprising nature in which this gigantic
bird played as leading a part, all of which may be found
duly set forth in the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another curious belief of the Arabs is in the existence
of a bird called the Hameh. This uncomfortable creation
of the Arab fancy is said to spring from the blood of a
murdered man. Its weird cry is continuously &ldquo;Iskoonee,&rdquo;
a word signifying &ldquo;give me to drink,&rdquo; and it rests not, day
nor night, till its thirst is quenched in the murderer&rsquo;s
blood. When the death of the victim is avenged it flies
away to some place left altogether indefinite in the
Eastern legend, but probably it wends its way to the
spirit-land with the welcome news that the victim&rsquo;s
blood no longer cries in vain for vengeance. To an
Arab already suffering from an evil conscience the
belief in the hameh must be a terrible one, as he
hears in fancy the troubled air filled with the wailing
cry and fierce demand for vengeance, and knows that,
day or night, the haunting sound will never leave his
ears until the desert feud be avenged and his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
life blood be poured out like water upon the burning
sand.</p>

<p>The depths of ocean, so impressive in their mystery
and vastness, have been peopled by the lovers of the
marvellous in all ages with a special fauna of their own,
and have been made the home of divers strange and
wondrous creatures, some purely reptilian, others fish-like,
or still more commonly a weird combination of the
two. The depths and recesses of the great tropical
forests, as impressive almost in their vastness as the
ocean itself, or the far-reaching swamps and morasses
in their mysterious shades, have in like manner been
tenanted in the imagination of the savage tribes that
thread their depths or probe their treacherous surface
with forms more wonderful even than those of Nature
herself, weird and bizarre as these in tropical regions so
frequently are. Hence amongst all savage tribes we
find a belief in serpentine forms more terrible even than
the boa or python that they have such cause to dread.
The widely spreading worship of the serpent, a form of
religion that we find in so many lands and throughout
centuries of time, is a most interesting subject of study,
though we can here only regret that exigencies of space
compel us to do no more than merely mention it.</p>

<p>The belief in sea-serpents does not appear in itself to
be an unreasonable one, much as it is from time to time
ridiculed. Many species of tropical snakes are aquatic
in a greater or less degree, and though some naturalists
will tell us that a serpent is not adapted by its structure
and organs for a purely aquatic existence, one finds in
nature so many wonderful adaptations of form to abnormal
circumstances, that it is perhaps wiser to feel that in the
great and almost boundless expanse of ocean there may be
mysterious forms that science has not yet tabulated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
described, rather than to at once assert the contrary.
Be this as it may, there is no doubt that while the great
mystery of the ocean depths has been tenanted by the
credulous with impossible creations of the fancy, we
have numerous testimonies from sea-captains and others
of appearances that cannot always be so lightly dismissed.
A Captain Harrington, for instance, commanding
the &ldquo;Castilian,&rdquo; during a voyage from Bombay to
Liverpool in the year 1857, sends the following account
to the <i>Times</i> newspaper:&mdash;&ldquo;While myself and officers
were standing on the lee side of the poop, looking
towards the island of St. Helena, then some ten miles
away, we were startled by the sight of a large marine
animal, which reared its head out of the water within
twenty yards of the ship, when it suddenly disappeared
for about half a minute, and then made its appearance
in the same manner again, showing us distinctly its neck
and head about ten or twelve feet out of the water. Its
head was shaped like a long buoy, and I suppose the
diameter to have been seven or eight feet in the largest
part, with a kind of scroll or tuft of loose skin encircling
it about two feet from the top. The second appearance
assured us that it was a monster of extraordinary length,
which appeared to be moving slowly towards the island.
The ship was going too fast to enable us to reach the
mast-head in time to form a correct estimate of its extreme
length, but from what we saw from the deck we
conclude that it must have been over two hundred feet
long. The boatswain and several of the crew, who
observed it from the forecastle, state that it was more
than double the length of the ship, in which case it
must have been five hundred feet. Be that as it may,
I am convinced that it belonged to the serpent tribe; it
was a dark colour about the head, and was covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
several white spots. Having a press of canvas on the
ship at the time, I was unable to round to without risk,
and therefore was precluded from getting another sight
of this leviathan of the deep.&rdquo; This precise description
was endorsed by the chief and second officers of the
ship&mdash;men, like the captain, of practised vision, and not
at all likely to be deceived by floating sea-weed or any
of the other matters brought forward to cast doubt on
such stories.</p>

<p>It is curious that another apparently well-authenticated
account of some such creature should also hail from
the neighbourhood of St. Helena. Her Majesty&rsquo;s ship
&ldquo;D&aelig;dalus,&rdquo; in August 1848, when on the passage between
that island and the Cape of Good Hope, came into
close proximity with a strange-looking creature that was
travelling through the water at an estimated speed of
ten miles an hour. Captain McQuahee was unable,
owing to the direction of the wind, to bring the ship
into pursuit, but, as the creature passed within two
hundred yards of them, they were enabled to bring it
well within observation, its form and colour being distinctly
visible from the vessel.</p>

<p>Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Upsal some three centuries
ago, was a firm believer in the marvellous, and in
his writings, amongst many other things, he gives details
of a sea-serpent two hundred feet long by twenty feet
thick, having a dense hairy mane and eyes of fire. This
monster, he further tells us, &ldquo;puts up its head on high
like a pillar and devours men.&rdquo; He also tells of another
kind, that is forty cubits long and no thicker than a
child&rsquo;s arm; this is blue and yellow in colour. His
writings also furnish a more detailed account of a vast
monster thrown ashore in 1532 on the English coast
near &ldquo;Tinmouth.&rdquo; This creature was ninety feet long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
and twenty-five feet thick, having thirty ribs on each side,
a head twenty-one feet long, and two fins of fifteen feet
each. This creature, from its proportions, fins, and so
forth, was evidently not serpentine in character, though
it may fairly be classed amongst monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>A Greenland missionary, Egede, tells in his journal
of a frightful sea-monster that he saw on July 6, 1734.
It raised itself so high out of the water, he says, that its
head overtopped the mainsail. It had a long and pointed
snout, and spouted like a whale; its fins were like great
wings. Another very circumstantial account is that
given by Captain Laurent de Ferry of Bergen in 1746.
His creature had a horse-like head, raised some two
feet out of the water; in colour it was grey, but it had
a white mane and large black eyes. Seven or eight
coils of the creature were visible, a fathom or so of
space between each. De Ferry says that he shot at and
wounded the monster, and that the water was reddened
with its blood for some time after. He does not specify
whether the weapon used was the longbow or not, but
it seems highly probable that it was.</p>

<p>Where the account given is so exceedingly definite as it
is, for example, in these two last instances, we are placed
in the awkward predicament of either having to believe
in the monster so graphically described, or to disbelieve
the narrators of the stories; to conclude, in plain words,
that Egede, despite his professions, was lying deliberately&mdash;a
very Munchausen&mdash;and that De Ferry was either a
credulous idiot himself, or wilfully concluded that the
landsmen&rsquo;s credulity might be safely played upon.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a long line of tumbling porpoises,
rolling after each other in the quaint way that
they do, may have deceived people into a belief that
what they saw were the coils of one of these great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
mythical monsters of the deep; but, however such an
appearance might deceive a landsman, it is evident that
those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy
themselves in the great waters are too familiar with the
appearance of a shoal of porpoises to be thus deceived.</p>

<p>The ribbon fish may in some cases have given rise to
the idea of a serpent of the sea, as the appearance of
their elongated, band-like bodies swimming through the
water with a gentle serpentine or undulatory motion
would be very suggestive. They have been known to
attain a length of sixty feet; specimens of this size have
actually been captured by trawlers, though even yet we
are a long way from the sea serpents gravely mentioned
by Pontoppidan in his &ldquo;Natural History of Norway&rdquo; as
being over six hundred feet long.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the reported appearance of the
sea serpent to Captain McQuahee, Professor Owen in a
letter published in the <i>Times</i> suggested that the creature
seen may have been one of the larger species of seals
found in the Southern Seas. At the Falkland Islands
and in the Kerguelen and Crozet groups the sea
elephant attains a size of some twenty feet in length, and
some such creature as this, swimming rapidly through
a calm sea with its head raised, and with a long wake
behind it, caused by the action of its paddles, placed at
the posterior extremity of the body, like the screw of a
steamer, may have been the foundation of some of the
stories told of these mysterious monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>A good sea-serpent story is found in Captain Taylor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Reminiscences.&rdquo; One day, when his ship was lying
at anchor in Table Bay, &ldquo;an enormous monster&rdquo; about
one hundred feet in length was seen advancing with
snake-like motion round Green Point into the harbour.
The head appeared to be crowned with long hair, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
the keener-sighted amongst the observers could see the
eyes and distinguish the features of the monster. The
military were called out, and after peppering the object
at a distance of five hundred yards, and making several
palpable hits, it was observed to become quite still, and
boats ventured off to complete the destruction. The
&ldquo;sea serpent&rdquo; proved to be a mass of gigantic sea-weed,
which had been undulated by the ground swell, and had
become quiescent when it reached the still waters of the
bay. Probably if mariners would attack the &ldquo;monster&rdquo;
in the same manner whenever it is seen, we should hear
little more of the sea serpent.</p>

<p>Stories of sea serpents are almost as old as the hills,
and in many cases quite as difficult to digest.</p>

<p>In 1808 the body of a great sea monster was cast
ashore at Stronsay, one of the Orkneys. This was some
fifty feet long, and every one, even the fishermen themselves,
declared that the sea serpent had turned up at
last. A naturalist, however, decided that it was only an
unusually fine specimen of the great basking shark; so
we are as far off as ever, after all, from an authentic monster,
and seem in every case to have only offered for our
acceptance either outrageous hoaxes and impositions,
the imaginations of the credulous, or, at the very best,
cases of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Amongst other serpent myths we may certainly place
that most uncomfortable creation of the fancy, the
Adissechen, a serpent with a thousand heads that, according
to the Indian mythology, bears up the universe;
and the Iormungandur, the serpent that according to
the Scandinavian myth, encircles the whole earth, and
binds it together in its flight through space.</p>

<p>It was a very old belief that the serpent&rsquo;s egg was
hatched by the joint labour of several serpents, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
buoyed up into the air by their hissing. Any one so
intrepid as to catch it while thus suspended &rsquo;twixt earth
and heaven bore away with him a talisman of mighty
power, giving him strength to prevail in every contest,
and the favour of all whose favour was worth the having.
It could only be captured at the gallop, and even then
the risk of being stung to death was a peril most
imminent. Pliny tells us that he had himself seen one
of these notable proofs of prowess, and that it was about
as large as a moderately large apple.</p>

<p>The Fire-Drake was, according to medi&aelig;val fancy,
a fiery serpent or dragon, keeping guard over hidden
treasure. The drake, of course, has no affinity with the
familiar ducks and drakes on the farmer&rsquo;s pool, nor
even with the ducks and drakes that people make of
their money when they burn their fingers in too rash
speculation, but is clearly suggested by the Latin word,
<i>draco</i>, for a dragon. We find an interesting reference
in Shakespeare to the word in his &ldquo;Henry VIII.,&rdquo; scene 3
of act v.&mdash;&ldquo;There is a fellow somewhat near the door;
he should be a brazier by his face, for, o&rsquo; my conscience,
twenty of the dog-days now reign in his nose: all that
stand about him are under the line, they need no further
penance. That fire-drake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Thaun in his &ldquo;Bestiary&rdquo; tells us of the Aspis, &ldquo;a
serpent cunning, sly, and aware of evil. When it perceives
people who make enchantment, who want to
enchant it, to take and snare it, it will stop very well the
ears it has. It will press one against the earth; in the
other it will stuff its tail firmly, so that it hears nothing.
In this manner do the rich people of the world: one ear
they have on earth to obtain riches, the other Sin stops
up; yet they will see a day, the day of Judgment. This
is the signification of the Aspis without doubt.&rdquo; De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
Thaun always endeavours to see a religious meaning in
everything, and where the moral declines to fit quite
accurately to the facts, by a simple process of reversal
the facts are made to fit to the moral. The creature
that he had in his mind, and which would naturally
occur to him from his familiarity with the Bible, is no
doubt identical with the deaf adder that we are told in
one of the Psalms stoppeth her ear, and refuseth to
hear the voice of the charmer. Though the old author
avowedly has no doubt as to the signification he assigns
to the creature&rsquo;s obstinate refusal to be charmed, one
cannot but feel that his explanation is rather halting. A
man who would amass riches has at least as much need
of his eyes as of his ears, and his transition from the ear
stopped up by sin to the awakened eye at the great day
of account is also somewhat lame. The transition should
have been not arbitrarily from one faculty to another, but
in the sharp contrast between the sense first deliberately
blunted and lost through sin, to be then at last terribly
restored by the trumpet peal of the dread day of doom.
Indeed, if it were not that we are all prepared instinctively
to place the worst possible construction upon anything
a creature so repellent to us may do, it is evident
that the allegory might have been equally developed
from quite another point of view. Had the dove shown
a similar alacrity to bury one ear in the earth while
it stuffed its tail into the other, we should have heard
nothing of this wilful blunting of the senses to good
counsel, but much, <i>au contraire</i>, of its determined
resistance to temptation and evil.</p>

<p>The ancients believed in a horrible little brute called
the Amphisbena, &ldquo;a small kind of serpent which moveth
backward or forward, and hath two heads, one at either
extreme.&rdquo; Galen, Pliny, Nicander, and many other early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
writers gravely describe this especially objectionable little
reptile. &AElig;lian, who was so far in advance of his age as
to call the Chim&aelig;ra and Hydra fables, believed fully in the
amphisbena. Some few serpents really have the power
of taking a mean advantage of those they assault by
springing at them from directions not always &ldquo;straight
to your front,&rdquo; as the drill sergeants express it,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but none,
of course, have an equal facility for moving either backward
or forward; and certainly still more of course, no
serpent at present known to science, or likely to be, has
a head &ldquo;at either extreme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kraken is another notable example of the studies
in unnatural history of the ancients. Pliny gravely
narrates that one of these monsters&mdash;the &ldquo;mountain
fish&rdquo; of the old Norsemen&mdash;haunted the ocean off the
coasts of Spain and North Africa, but, owing to its bulk,
was unable to penetrate through the Straits of Gibraltar
into the Mediterranean. According to some old writers
the kraken, when floating on the surface of the sea,
stretched to a length of about a mile and a half, and
appeared like an island. It is a difficult problem to
say which would be the most embarrassing position&mdash;for
a seaman to find himself stranded on the creature&rsquo;s back
on its sudden arrival at the surface, or to be engulfed
in the whirlpool that would arise from its sinking again
into the depths of ocean. One old writer tells us of a
party of sailors that, from the tangled sea-weed on the
creature&rsquo;s back, took the kraken for an island, and after
fishing for some time with some little success in the
pools of water in the hollows of his back, proceeded
to light a fire to cook their take, and suddenly found
themselves engulfed in the sea when the heat became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
sufficiently great to awaken their animated island from
its nap. Alaus Magnus, archbishop of Upsala, describes
this colossus of the deep as the kraken, but he stops
short at the length of a mile; while Pontoppidan, bishop
of Bergen, adds that a whole regiment of soldiers could
man&oelig;uvre on its back; while yet a third ecclesiastic,
another bishop, tells us that he did actually erect an altar
on the creature&rsquo;s back and celebrate mass. We are told
that the kraken submitted to the ceremony without
flinching, but no sooner was it over than it plunged into
the depths of the sea, to the great astonishment and peril
of the divine. It may at first seem curious that so many
of these stories should spring from ecclesiastics, but it
must be remembered that they were in these early days
the great repositories of truth, the laity being steeped in
ignorance and superstition.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the kraken myth has
sprung from stories of gigantic cuttle-fish or octopus,
the devil fish described so vividly by Victor Hugo in
his &ldquo;Toilers of the Sea;&rdquo; but one can hardly fall in quite
readily with this notion, since the leading idea, so to
speak, in the kraken belief is that of a monstrous and
quiescent mass, suggestive more than anything else of
an island rising from the sea, while the dominant idea
in our minds of the octopus is of a creature armed with
far-stretching and numerous arms that enwrap their
hapless victim in their pitiless embrace. The kraken
would scarcely have been described without any reference
to these fearful feelers, armed with double rows of
suckers, if the myth had had the origin that has been
in several directions claimed for it. The belief in the
kraken chiefly springs, probably, from that delight in
something tremendously big that has also given us the
roc carrying away elephants in its talons, or the serpent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
that encompasses the world in its folds, so that we need
not then too anxiously strive to find any counterpart of
it in nature.</p>

<p>De Thaun describes something very kraken-like, but
he bestows upon it the title of Cetus. <i>Cetus</i>, we need
scarcely remind our readers, is a Latin word applied in
a general sense to all kinds of large sea-fish, and though
the whale is strictly speaking a mammal and not a fish
at all, we find the word reappearing in modern use in
the term cetaceous, as applied to all creatures of the
whale kind. The author of the &ldquo;Bestiary&rdquo; tells us that
&ldquo;Cetus is a very great beast; it lives always in the sea.
It takes the sand of the sea, spreads it on its back,
raises itself up in the sea, and will be at tranquillity.
The seafarer sees it, and thinks that it is an island, and
goes to arrive there to prepare his meal. The Cetus
feels the fire and the ship and the people; then he will
plunge if he can, and drown them. When he wants to
eat he begins to gape, and the gaping of his mouth sends
forth a smell so sweet, that the little fish will enter into
his mouth, and then he will kill them, thus will he swallow
them.&rdquo; In a Jewish work entitled &ldquo;Bara Bathra&rdquo; we read
of a whale so large that a ship was three days in sailing
from its head to its tail. Of course this would not be
at Cunard liner pace; still it certainly does give one the
idea of a very considerable fish. But this monster of
the deep sinks into insignificance in its length of but a
hundred miles or so when we compare it with the fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
Pheg (mentioned in an ancient Chinese book, the Tsi-hiai),
that churns up five hundred miles of blue ocean
into silvery foam when it starts its stupendous paddles
in motion for a cruise. This is indeed, to quote Polonius,
&ldquo;very like a whale.&rdquo; When any one&rsquo;s credulity finds no
difficulty in digesting such a tale as that, their powers
of absorption must be well nigh as striking as the narration
itself.</p>

<p>According to Jewish tradition the Leviathan was a
great fish; so great, they taught, that one day it swallowed
another fish nearly a thousand miles long. Many of
the Jewish legends in the Talmud and elsewhere possess
little or nothing of graceful fancy, but simply endeavour
to excite wonder by gross exaggeration. There were
originally two of these leviathans, a male and a female;
but if their numbers had increased beyond this, the
world would have been soon destroyed; so the female
was killed, and laid up in salt for the great feast to be
held at the coming of the Messiah. Such is the Jewish
tradition. Leviathan is mentioned in the Bible in
several places, notably in the magnificent description
that comprises the whole of the forty-first chapter of the
book of Job. It is curious that a very similar legend to
that we have just referred to was believed by the Jews
in connection with the Behemoth mentioned in the preceding
chapter of Job. Any one reading the fine description
of the creature there given will have little difficulty
in agreeing with most commentators that the hippopotamus
is intended; but the Jews held that behemoth
is a huge animal which has subsisted alone since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
creation, and that it is reserved to be fattened for the
great rejoicings that are to be held in the days of the
advent of the promised Messiah. Every day they believe
that he eats up the grass of a thousand hills, and that
at each draught, when he is thirsty, he swallows up as
much water as the Jordan yields in the course of six
months.</p>

<p>It would probably be found that nine out of ten people
would at once declare that their idea of the leviathan
was that it was a large fish, and the tenth person would
have very little doubt either. We do not mean that
these typical folk would really believe in its existence
as a special monster, but they would be quite prepared
to say in an offhand way that the whale was intended
under this name. Burton in his &ldquo;Miracles of Art and
of Nature&rdquo; (<small>A.D.</small> 1678) has a passage that clearly shows
this interchange of words, and the evident idea that the
two terms, whale and leviathan, are synonymous. He
writes, under the description of Norway&mdash;&ldquo;The whales
do so terrifie the shores, the Seas being there so deep,
and therefore a fit habitation for those great leviathans.&rdquo;
He, however, goes on to tell us that &ldquo;the People of the
Sea-coast have found a remedy, which is by casting some
water intermixt with Oyle of Castor, the smell whereof
forces them immediately to retire, and without this help
there were no Fishing on the Coasts.&rdquo; The remedy for
the boisterous presence of these great monsters seems
at first a feeble one, until we bear in mind how gladly
we too in our child-days would have immediately retired,
if we could, at the awful odour of the coming castor-oil.
&ldquo;One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beautiful description of the wonders of creation
in the 104th Psalm, the stretching firmament and the
chariots of cloud, the fowls of heaven, and the trees so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
full of sap and vigour, concludes with a reference to
the leviathan that has no doubt done much to associate
the name with the whale,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and which, in fact, could only
apply to some such great creature of the waters; so that
we can only conclude that the term was used somewhat
vaguely by the different Old Testament writers, as it is
now tolerably unanimously held that the leviathan of
the book of Job is the crocodile.</p>

<p>No creature of the whale tribe inhabits the Mediterranean;
neither is the whale clothed in coat-of-mail, nor
is it fierce in disposition; but if any one will carefully
read the description given of the crocodile in the book
of Job they will find point after point of appropriate
detail, allowance being made partly for the wealth of
Oriental and poetic imagery, and partly for the wonderful
difference between assailing the crocodile in these later
days with a rifle-ball as against the old sling, spear, or
arrow. What a modern sportsman might lightly esteem
would be a very different creature indeed to attack when
the world was in its youth.</p>

<p>is equally impracticable. The sad fiction-dispelling truth
is, that in no case does the little argonaut use its arms
as sails or as oars. It rises, it is true, occasionally to
the surface, as other cuttle-fish forms do, but when there
its only means of propulsion are the <i>jets d&rsquo;eau</i> from its
funnel, these jets consisting of the water which has been
used in respiration. In Pliny&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; as translated
by Philemon Holland, and published in London in
1601, we find that &ldquo;among the greatest wonders of nature
is that fish which of some is called nautilos, of others
pompilos. This fish, for to come aloft upon the water,
turneth upon his backe, and raiseth or heaveth himselfe
up by little and little; and to the end he might swim
with more ease as disburdened of a sinke, he dischargeth
all the water within him at a pipe. After this, turning
up his two foremost clawes or armes, hee displaieth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
stretcheth out betweene them a membrane or skin of a
wonderful thinnesse: this serveth him instead of a saile
in the aire above water. With the rest of his armes or
clawes he roweth and laboureth under water, and with
his tail in the midst he directeth his course, and steereth
as it were with an helme. Thus holdeth he on and
maketh way in the sea, with a fair show of a galley under
saile. Now if he be afraide of anything by the way, hee
makes no more adoe, but draweth in water to baillise his
bodie, and so plungeth himselfe downe and sinketh to
the bottome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Dolphin, like the nautilus, has a veritable
existence, and may be duly found amongst the works of
nature, it has also, like the nautilus again, served as the
foundation for a considerable amount of mythical lore.
Thus Pliny, in his so-called Natural History, from which
we have already drawn so many curious extracts, writes&mdash;&ldquo;The
swiftest of all other living creatures whatsoever,
and not of sea-fish only, is the dolphin; quicker
than the flying fowl, swifter than the arrow shot out
of a bow.&rdquo; The dolphin, so termed, of the medi&aelig;val
heralds is a purely conventional form, having no counterpart
whatever in Nature. &ldquo;They are much deceived,&rdquo;
wrote an authority on natural history a little more than
a hundred years ago, &ldquo;who imagine Dolphins to be of
the Figure they are usually represented on Signs; that
Error being more owing to the unbridled License of
Statuaries or Painters than to any such Thing found in
Fact.&rdquo; A much earlier writer, Gillius, tells us that when
he was &ldquo;in a Ship where many Dolphins were taken, he
observed them so to deplore with Groans, Lamentations,
and a Flood of Tears their Condition, that he himself, out
of Compassion, could not forbear weeping, and so threw
one that he observed to groan more than ordinary (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
Fisherman being asleep) into the Water again, as choosing
rather to damage the Fisherman than not to relieve the
Miserable. But this gave him but little Rest, for all the
Others increased their Groans, as seeming, by not obscure
Signs, to beg the same Deliverance.&rdquo; Another well-known
belief in connection with the dolphin is the imaginary
brilliancy of its supposititiously changeful colours when,
having failed to find any one, like Gillius, compassionate
enough to throw it overboard, it presently succumbs to
its hard fate. The idea has been a favourite one with
poets in all ages, but one example from Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe
Harold&rsquo;s Pilgrimage&rdquo; will suffice as an illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Parting day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a new colour as it gasps away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last still loveliest, till&mdash;&rsquo;tis gone&mdash;and all is gray.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>According to some of the ancient writers, the eyes of
the dolphin were in those most unlikely and unserviceable
places, their blade-bones; they were also said to
dig graves for their dead on the sandy shores of the sea,
and to follow them to their burial in mournful procession.
They were, too, an excellent means of travelling
when other means of locomotion were not available.
Thus the fifty daughters of Nereus travelled in safety
on their backs, we are told in classic mythology in the
dry-as-dust style of such fountains of knowledge as are
available for reference ordinarily; but these statements
help us but little to realise the scene that struck the
eyes or the imaginations of the ancients when this bevy
of charming girls, a good fifty strong, rode hither and
thither in happy <i>abandon</i> in the brilliant summer sunlight
of the azure Mediterranean Sea, their steeds the
willing dolphins; a scene as unlike the frowsy omnibuses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
the dreary chariots of moody men and women, that loom
through the murk of a London fog, or that fill to suffocation
with resentful fellow passengers, when the prolonged
drizzle becomes a heavy downpour, as one can possibly
imagine.</p>

<p>The dolphin&rsquo;s love of music, again, was a firm article
of faith to the ancients, and most of our readers are no
doubt acquainted with the story of the sweet singer, Arion,
who, forced to leap into the sea to escape the cruelty
of the sailors, escaped to land on the back of a dolphin&mdash;one
of many that had long followed the ship in rapturous
appreciation of the sweet melodies of the singer; and
how Arion&mdash;</p>

<p>Another strange fish believed in by our forefathers
was the Acipenser, &ldquo;a fish of an unnatural making and
quality,&rdquo; as an old writer terms him; and indeed he
may very well do so, as we are told that &ldquo;his scales are
all turned towards the head.&rdquo; We are not, therefore, much
surprised to learn that &ldquo;he ever swimmeth against the
stream,&rdquo; though we might well be still more astonished
if we ever found him swimming at all.</p>

<p>The Remora. This was held to affix itself so firmly
to a ship that neither wind nor waves could dislodge it,
while its presence (even worse than that of the more
prosaic barnacles and other sea impedimenta that plague
the modern shipowner by fouling the bottom of his good
ship, and so retarding her course) brought the voyage to an
abrupt conclusion. Pliny indeed only says that &ldquo;there
is a little fish, keeping ordinarily about rockes, named

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
these marvels have a wonderful way of growing more and
more marvellous, and subsequent writers, not content with
merely impeding the vessels in their increasingly wondrous
stories, soon accredited the remora with the much
more striking power of altogether arresting their progress.
We see a relic and survival of this old belief in the following
lines of Ben Jonson&mdash;</p>

<p>We have already seen how Leviathan, according to
the Talmud, is to form a feast for the Saints; and on
turning to the Koran we find a very similar belief, for
the food of Mohammed&rsquo;s Paradise is to consist, we are
there told, of the flesh of the ox Balam and of the fish
Nun. To allay any apprehension on the part of the
faithful that these viands will not &ldquo;go round,&rdquo; as a
schoolboy would say, we are reassured on reading that
the liver alone of the fish Nun will supply an adequate
portion for seventy thousand hungry souls.</p>

<p>The vastness and mystery of the depths of the sea has
naturally led to their being peopled at all ages and amidst
almost all peoples with strange and monstrous forms like
the Chilon, fish-like in body, but having the head of a
man; or the Dies, the creature of a day, whose life&rsquo;s span
ran its course in the hours between the rising and the
setting of the sun; or more rarely with forms of more
poetic beauty, like those sweet water-wagtails, the mermaidens
we have already alluded to. Our illustration is
a representation of the sea lion as believed in, or at least
delineated, by the author of one of the medi&aelig;val treatises
on more or less natural history that has come under our
notice. &AElig;lian describes fish having the heads of lions,
rams, and so forth; and it is, of course, sufficiently
evident that when a man has once got upon that train of
ideas there is nothing to hinder his turning the whole
&ldquo;Zoological Gardens&rdquo; into the shadowy depths of
ocean, and evolving from his inner consciousness not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
only camel-fish or gazelle-fish, but fifty other equally
striking creations. Rondelet, in a book published in
the year 1554, gives sufficiently strange illustrations of
sea-bishops and sea-monks; and another medi&aelig;val
writer, Francisci Boussetti, represents in all good faith
other forms equally bizarre; but the greatest storehouse
by far, so far as our own experience of these old authors
goes, is to be found in the &ldquo;Historia Monstrorum&rdquo; of
Aldrovandus, a book most copiously illustrated, and full
of the most extraordinary conglomerations of diverse
creatures, or of wild imaginings that find no counterpart
in any way in Nature at all. Of these we need give but
one example, the very peculiar biped here represented.</p>

<p>Most of us, even the veriest landsmen, must have
heard of &ldquo;Davy Jones&rsquo;s Locker,&rdquo; though few could give
it a &ldquo;local habitation&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;a name.&rdquo; Almost
all superstitious people&mdash;and certainly sailors as a body
may be classed as such&mdash;have a great objection to telling
their beliefs to those whom they think will not receive
their communications in a sympathetic spirit; hence it
is often exceedingly difficult in most cases to arrive at
all at a satisfactory conclusion, as, even after an explanation
has been given, we find that what we were told was
a mere putting off of the matter at issue, and their real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
belief has all the time been concealed from us. The
following explanation of the seaman&rsquo;s phrase we give
for what it is worth, which in our humble opinion is
not much. We are told that Jones is a corruption of
Jonah the prophet, while <i>deva</i> or <i>duffa</i> amongst the
natives of the West India islands is a spirit or ghost.
The sailor&rsquo;s locker, we are all aware, is the one place on
board where his private possessions are more or less safe,
so that when we hear of an unfortunate having gone to
Davy Jones&rsquo;s Locker, we may conclude that he is believed
to have gone to some far-down place of safe-keeping
in the Spirit-world, as Jonah, by inference, did. It is,
however, a decidedly weak point in this explanation
that Jonah, whatever may have been his experiences in
the depths of the sea, soon exchanged his temporary
&ldquo;locker&rdquo; for dry land again, and was no doubt ultimately
gathered to his fathers in the bosom of mother-earth.
Smollett, in his &ldquo;Peregrine Pickle,&rdquo; ignores all reference
to the faithless prophet, and, without seeking out the why
or the wherefore of the name, goes, we think, very much
more directly to the point when he writes&mdash;&ldquo;This same
Davy Jones, according to the mythology of sailors, is the
fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep,
and is seen in various shapes, warning the devoted
wretch of death and woe.&rdquo; Like the Irish Church and
many other venerable institutions, Davy is now probably
disestablished, or shelved like some fine old admiral on
the half-pay list, though it would be interesting to hear
the opinion of some navy chaplain on the point, as these
old superstitions die very hardly, and at times rather
clash with more orthodox theology.</p>

<p>The widespread worship of the serpent is a subject of
the greatest interest, though it would take us far away
from our present subject if we dwelt at length upon it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
The place held by the serpent in ancient mythologies has,
however, caused the creature to pass far from the region
of commonplace zoological fact into the realm of myth.</p>

<p>One old belief more precise than nice was that the
serpent first vomits forth its venom before drinking, in
order that it may not poison itself by swallowing it;
while another curious belief was, that sleeping children
whose ears were licked by serpents thereby received
the gift of foretelling future events. Cassandra was said
thus, amongst other less famous personages more or less
believed in by the ancients, to have received the gift of
prophecy.</p>

<p>In Squier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Serpent Worship in America&rdquo; many
legends are given that admirably illustrate the feelings of
the North American aborigines, the Peruvians, Mexicans,
and other dwellers on that continent with regard to the
great serpent that typifies to them, as to so many other
races, the great Evil Power.</p>

<p>One of these, an Ojibiway legend, we must venture on
quoting, for, somewhat lengthy as it is, it supplies an
excellent illustration of this belief in the malign power
of the serpent, and incidentally gives an echo of the
widespread belief in a deluge, a belief extending from
the legends of the Far West to those of distant China.</p>

<p>The Indian legend runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;One day, on
returning to his lodge in the wilderness after a long
journey, Manabazho, the great teacher, missed from it
his young cousin: he called his name aloud, but received
no answer. He looked around on the sand for the
tracks of his feet, and he there for the first time discovered
the trail of Meshekenabek, the Great Serpent.
He then knew that his cousin had been seized by his
great enemy. He armed himself and followed on his
track: he passed the great river and crossed mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
and valleys to the shores of the deep and gloomy lake,
now called Manitou Lake, Spirit Lake, or the Lake of
Devils. The trail of Meshekenabek led to the edge of
the water. At the bottom of this lake was the dwelling of
the serpent, and it was filled with evil spirits, his attendants
and companions. Their forms were monstrous and
terrible, but most, like their master, bore the semblance
of serpents. In the centre of this horrible assemblage
was Meshekenabek himself, coiling his voluminous folds
round the cousin of Manabazho. His head was red as
with blood, and his eyes were fierce and glowed like fire:
his body was all over armed with hard and glistening
scales of every shade and colour. Manabazho looked
down upon the writhing spirits of evil, and he vowed
deep revenge. He directed the clouds to disappear
from the heavens, the winds to be still, and the air to
become stagnant over the lake of the Manitous, and bade
the sun shine on it with all its fierceness; for thus he
sought to drive his enemy forth to seek the cool shadows
of the trees that grew upon its banks, so that he might
be able to take vengeance upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile Manabazho seized his bow and arrows,
and placed himself near the spot where he deemed the
serpents would come to enjoy the shade; he then transformed
himself into the stump of a withered tree, that
his enemies might not discover his presence. The winds
became still, the air stagnant, the sun shone hot upon
the lake of the evil Manitous. By-and-by the waters
became troubled, and bubbles rose to the surface, for
the rays of the hot sun penetrated to the horrible brood
within its depths. The commotion increased, and a serpent
lifted up its head high above the centre of the lake
and gazed around the shores. Directly another came
to the surface, and they listened for the footsteps of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
Manabazho; but they heard him nowhere on the face of
the earth, and they said one to another, &lsquo;Manabazho
sleeps,&rsquo; and then they plunged again beneath the waters,
which seemed to hiss as they closed over them. It
was not long before the Lake of Manitous became more
troubled than before; it boiled from its very depths,
and the hot waves dashed wildly against the rocks on
its shores. The commotion increased, and soon Meshekenabek,
the Great Serpent, emerged slowly to the surface
and moved toward the shore. His blood-red crest glowed
with a deeper hue, and the reflection from his glancing
scales was like the blinding glitter of a snow-covered
forest beneath the morning sun of winter. He was
followed by all the evil spirits, so great a number that
they covered the shores of the lake with their foul and
trailing carcases. They saw the broken, blasted stump
into which Manabazho had transformed himself, and
suspecting it might be one of his disguises, one of them
approached and wound his tail around it, and sought
to drag it down, but Manabazho stood firm, though he
could hardly refrain from crying aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Serpent wound his vast folds among the
trees of the forest, and the rest also sought the shade,
while one was left to listen for the steps of Manabazho.
When they all slept Manabazho drew an arrow from his
quiver; he placed it in his bow, and aimed it where he
saw the heart beat against the sides of the Great Serpent.
He launched it, and with a howl that shook the mountains
and startled the wild beasts in their caves, the
monster awoke, and, followed by its frightened companions,
uttering mingled sounds of rage and terror,
plunged again into the lake. When the Great Serpent
knew that he was mortally wounded, both he and the
evil spirits around him were rendered tenfold more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
terrible by their great wrath, and they arose to overwhelm
Manabazho. The water of the lake swelled
upwards from its dark depths, and with a sound like
many thunders it rolled madly on his track, bearing the
rocks and trees before it with resistless fury. High on
the crest of the foremost wave, black as the midnight,
rode the writhing form of the wounded Meshekenabek,
and red eyes glared around him, and the hot breaths of
the monstrous brood hissed fiercely after the retreating
Manabazho. Then thought Manabazho of his Indian
children, and he ran by their villages, and in a voice of
alarm bade them flee to the mountains, for the Great
Serpent was deluging the earth in his expiring wrath,
sparing no living thing. The Indians caught up their
children, and wildly sought safety where he bade them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manabazho continued his flight along the base of the
western hills, and finally took refuge on a high mountain
beyond Lake Superior, far to the North. There he
found many men and animals who had fled from the flood
that already covered the valleys and plains, and even
the highest hills. Still the waters continued to rise, and
soon all the mountains were overwhelmed, save that on
which stood Manabazho. Then he gathered together
timber and made a raft, upon which the men and women
and the animals that were with him all placed themselves.
No sooner had they done so than the rising floods closed
over the mountain, and they floated alone on the surface
of the waters. And thus they floated many days; and
some died, and the rest became sorrowful, and reproached
Manabazho that he did not disperse the waters and
renew the earth, that they might live. But though he
knew that his great enemy was by this time dead, yet
could he not renew the world unless he had some earth
in his hands wherewith to commence the work. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
he explained to those who were with him, and he said
that were it ever so little, even a few grains, then could
he disperse the waters and renew the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beaver then volunteered to go to the bottom
of the deep and get some earth, and they all applauded
her design. She plunged in, and they waited long:
when she returned she was dead; they opened her
hands, but there was no earth in them. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the
otter, &lsquo;will I seek the earth,&rsquo; and the bold swimmer dived
from the raft. The otter was gone still longer than the
beaver, but when he returned to the surface he too was
dead, and there was no earth in his claws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who shall find the earth?&rsquo; exclaimed all those on the
raft, &lsquo;now that the beaver and the otter are dead?&rsquo; &lsquo;That
will I,&rsquo; said the musk-rat, and he quickly disappeared
between the logs of the raft. The musk-rat was gone
very much longer than the otter, and it was thought that
he would never return, when he suddenly rose close by,
but he was too weak to speak, and he swam slowly
towards the raft. He had hardly got upon it when he
too died from his great exertion. They opened his little
hands, and there, closely clasped between the fingers,
they found a few grains of fresh earth. These Manabazho
carefully collected and dried in the sun, and then he
rubbed them into fine powder in his palms, and rising up
he blew them abroad upon the waters. No sooner was
this done than the flood began to subside, and soon the
trees on the mountains were seen, and then the mountains
and hills emerged from the deep, and the plains
and the valleys came into view, and the waters disappeared
from the land. Then it was found that the
Great Serpent, Meshekenabek, was dead, and that the evil
Manitous, his companions, had returned to the depths of
the Lake of Spirits, from which, for the fear of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
Manabazho, they never more dared to come forth. In gratitude
to the beaver, the otter, and the musk-rat, these animals
were ever after held sacred by the Indians, and they
became their brethren; and they were never killed nor
molested until the medicine-men of the stranger made
them forget their relations and turned their hearts to
ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we propose to deal, in conclusion, with some few
examples of the fabledom that has grown around various
plants, we may fitly usher in this new section of our subject
with some little account of the old belief that the
barnacle-shells of our shores, or, as some writers held, a
tree called the barnacle-tree, developed into Solan-geese,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
as the transition from the mythical animal kingdom to
the fabulous vegetable kingdom will thus be rendered
less abrupt.</p>

<p>This barnacle-goose tree was a great article of faith
with our ancestors in the Middle Ages. Gerarde, for
example, in his History of Plants gives an illustration of
it in all good faith&mdash;a branch bearing barnacles and by
its side a barnacle goose. Following, however, the plan
we have adopted throughout of going directly to the
fountain-head, Gerarde shall give us his own description
of this wonder of Nature. We may, however, point out
before doing so that the error arose from a near resemblance
of two distinct words suggesting that there must be
an identity of nature in the things so named. A common
kind of shell was in the Middle Ages called pernacula,
while the Solan-goose, in France called the barnache,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
was the bernacula. Both words being popularly corrupted
into barnacle, it was natural that the two things should be
considered as identical. Gerarde saves this crowning
wonder until the end of his book, and then discourses
as follows concerning it:&mdash;&ldquo;Hauing trauelled from the
grasses growing in the bottom of the fenny waters, the
woods, and mountaines, euen vnto Libanus it selfe; and
also the sea, and bowels of the same, wee are arriued at
the end of our Historie: thinking it not impertinent
to the conclusion of the same, to end with one of the
maruells of this land (we may say of the world). The
historie whereof to set forth according to the worthinesse
and raritie thereof would not only require a large and
peculiar volume, but also a deeper search into the bowels
of nature than mine intended purpose wil suffer me to
wade into, my sufficience also considered; leauing the
historie thereof rough hewen unto some excellent men,
learned in the secrets of nature, to be both fined and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
refined: in the meantime take it as it falleth out, the
naked and bare truth, though vnpolished. There are
found in the North parts of Scotland and the Island
adiacient, called Orchades, certain trees whereon do grow
certaine shells of a white colour tending to russet, wherein
are contained little liuing creatures, which shells in time
of maturitie do open, and out of them do grow those
little liuing things, which falling in the water do become
fowles, which we call Barnakles; in the North of England
trant geese, and in Lancashire tree geese; but the other
that do fall vpon the land perish and come to nothing.
Thus much by the writings of others, and also from the
mouths of people of those parts, which may very well
accord with truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what our eyes have seene and hands haue touched
we shall declare. There is a small Island in Lancashire
called the pile of Foulders, wherein are found the broken
pieces of old and bruised ships, some whereof have been
cast thither by Shipwracke, and also the trunks and bodies
with the branches of old and rotten trees cast up there
likewise; whereon is found a certain spume or froth that
in time breedeth vnto certain shels in shape like those of
the Muskle, but sharper pointed and of a whitish colour,
wherein is contained a thing in forme like a lace of silke
finely wouen as it were together, one end thereof is fastened
vnto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which
in time commeth to the shape and forme of a Birde.
When it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open, and
the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or
string; next come the legs of the bird hanging out, and
as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by degrees til
at length it is all come forth and hangeth onely by the
bill; in short space after it commeth to full maturitie
and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth feathers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
groweth to a fowle bigger than a Mallard and lesser than
a goose, hauing blacke legs, and bill and beake, and
feathers blacke and white spotted in such manner as is
our magpie, which the people of Lancashire call by no
other name than a tree goose: which place aforesaid and
all those parts adjoining do so much abound thereinth
that one of the best is bought for three pence. For the
truth hereof, if any doubt, may it please them to repaire
unto me, and I shall satisfie them by the testimonie of
good witnesses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover it would seeme that there is another sort
hereof; the historie of which is true and of mine owne
knowledge: for trauelling vpon the shore of our English
coast betweene Douer and Rumney, I found the trunke
of an olde rotten tree, which (with some helpe that I
procured by fishermen&rsquo;s wives that were there attending
their husbands returne from the sea) we drew out of
the water upon dry land: vpon this rotten tree I found
growing many thousands of long crimson bladders, in
shape like vnto puddings newly filled, which were very
clear and shining: at the nether end whereof did grow
a shell fish fashioned somewhat like a small Muskle,
but much whiter, resembling a shell fish that groweth
vpon the rokes about Garnsey and Garsey, called a
lympit. Many of these shells I brought with me to
London, which after I had opened I found in them
liuing things without form or shape: in others which
were nearer come to ripeness I found liuing things that
were very naked, shaped like a bird: in others the birds
couered with soft downe, the shell halfe open and the
bird ready to fall out, which no doubt were the fowles
called Barnakles. I dare not absolutely avouch euery
circumstance of the first part of this history concerning
the tree that beareth those buds aforesaid, but will leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
it to a further consideration, howbeit that which I have
seen with mine eyes and handled with mine hands, I
dare confidently avouch and boldly put down for veritie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They spawn as it were in March and Aprille: the
geese are formed in May and June and come to fulnesse
of feathers in the moneth after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thus hauing through God&rsquo;s assistance discoursed
somewhat at large of Grasses, Herbes, Shrubs, Trees,
and Mosses, and certain Excrescences of the earth, with
other things more incident to the historie thereof, we
conclude and end our present volume with this wonder
of England. For the which God&rsquo;s name be ever honored
and praised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We extract the foregoing from the first edition of
&ldquo;Gerarde&rsquo;s Historie of Plants,&rdquo; published in 1597.
After his death Thomas Johnson, &ldquo;Citizen and Apothecarie
of London,&rdquo; brought out another edition in 1633,
and he adds the following note to Gerarde&rsquo;s statement:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Barnakle, whose fabulous breed my Author here
sets downe, and diuers others haue also delieured, were
found by some Hollanders to haue another originall,
and that by egges, as other birds haue; for they in their
third voyage to finde out the North-East passage to
China and the Moluccos about the eightieth degree and
eleven minutes of Northerly latitude, found two little
islands, in the one of which they found abundance of
these geese sitting upon their egges, of which they got
one goose and tooke away sixty egges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parkinson, in his &ldquo;Theater of Plants,&rdquo; published in
1640, gives a picture of a barnacle-tree growing by the
sea-shore, and several geese swimming beneath it, at
the end of the description of the 14th tribe of plants,
&ldquo;Marsh Water, and Sea Plants, with Mosses and
Mushromes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
Though the insertion of the woodcut, as our readers
will see, would give one at a casual glance the impression
that he was a believer, his comments are sufficiently
indicative of his state of mind:&mdash;&ldquo;To finish this treatise
of sea plants let me bring this admirable tale of untruth
to your consideration, that whatever hath formerly beene
related concerning the breeding of these Barnakles to
be from shels growing on trees, &amp;c., is utterly erroneous,
their breeding and hatching being found out by the
Dutch and others in their navigations to the Northward,
as that third of the Dutch in Anno 1536 doth declare.&rdquo;
As Gerarde&rsquo;s book was published after the Dutch narrative,
we can only conclude that he either had not seen
it or that he is one more illustration of the old saying
that &ldquo;A man convinced against his will, remains the
same opinion still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Munster&rsquo;s Cosmography, a book which was several
times reprinted between 1550 and 1570, we find an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
illustration of the wonderful goose-yielding tree, which we
here reproduce in facsimile. Munster discourses as
follows on the matter:&mdash;&ldquo;In Scotland are found trees,
the fruit of which appears like a ball of leaves. This
fruit, falling at its proper time into the water below, becomes
animated and turns to a bird which they call the
tree-goose. This tree also grows in the island of Pomona,
not far distant from Scotland towards the north.&rdquo; Saxo
Grammaticus, another old cosmographer, also mentions
this tree. &AElig;neas Sylvius notices it too; he says&mdash;&ldquo;We
have heard that there was a tree formerly in Scotland,
which growing by the margin of a stream produced fruit
of the shape of ducks; that such fruit, when nearly ripe,
fell, some into the water and some on land. Such as
fell on land decayed, but such as fell into the water
quickly became animated, swimming below, and then
flying into the air with feathers and wings. When in
Scotland, having made diligent enquiry concerning this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
matter of King James, we found that the miracle always
kept receding, as this wonderful tree is not found in
Scotland but in the Orcadian isles.&rdquo; &AElig;neas Sylvius,
afterwards better known to the world as Pope Pius II.,
visited Scotland in the year 1448. His book is in
the Latin tongue. William Turner, one of the earliest
writers on Ornithology, describes the Bernacle goose as
being produced from &ldquo;something like a fungus growing
from old wood lying in the sea.&rdquo; He quotes Giraldus
Cambrensis as his authority for the statement, but says
he, &ldquo;As it seemed not safe to popular report, and as, on
account of the singularity of the thing, I could not give
entire credit to Giraldus, I, when thinking of the subject
of which I now write, asked a certain clergyman, named
Octavianus, by birth an Irishman, whom I knew to be
worthy of credit, if he thought the account of Giraldus
was to be believed. He swearing by the gospel, declared
that what Giraldus had written about the generation of
this bird was most true; that he had himself seen and
handled the young unformed birds, and that if I should
remain in London a month or two he would bring me
some of the brood.&rdquo; In Lobel and Pena&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stirpium
Adversaria Nova,&rdquo; published in London in 1570, there
is a figure of the &ldquo;Britannica Concha Anatifera&rdquo; growing
on a stem from a rock, while beneath, in the water, ducks
are swimming about. In his description the writer refers
to the accepted belief in such a bird, but declines expressing
an opinion of his own until he shall have had
an opportunity of visiting Scotland and judging for himself.
Ferrer de Valcebro, a Spanish writer who wrote a
book on birds in 1680, tells the story of the production
from a tree of a bird he calls the Barliata, and lectures
his countrymen soundly at their want of belief, and more
than insinuates that it is not really so much a want of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
faith as a contemptible jealousy because the wonder is
not found on Spanish soil.</p>

<p>A still more wonderful tree must be the Kalpa-Tarou
mentioned in the Hindu mythology, since from this can
be gathered not only Solan-geese, but what else may be
desired. Whether so multitudinous an array of articles
as may be included in the idea of whatever any one and
every one, no matter how diverse their tastes may be,
could desire, all hung exposed to the view, like the
varied display on a Christmas-tree, or whether they
sprang into existence as called for, we are unable to say.
In either case the tree would be a most valuable possession;
the housewife would no longer have to wait for the
plums or raspberries to ripen for jam-making, but could
at once, even in midwinter, replenish her waning stores
with an abundant supply all ready-made; while the connoisseur
of choice old etchings, the collectors of rare
coins, or the schoolboy earnestly desiring a six-bladed
knife could all equally go away with their varied requirements
met. The tree is also called the tree of the
imagination; and it might, we fear, be equally called the
imaginary tree, as all the resources of science are strained
in vain to tell us anything more definite about it.</p>

<p>Mohammed tells us in the Koran that a Lote-tree
stands in the seventh heaven on the right hand of the
throne of Allah, an idea derived, no doubt, from that Tree
of Life that bloomed a while in earthly Eden, and that
shall be found again in the celestial Paradise of God.
The mystical tree that passes out of sight in the earliest
chapters of the Bible as the woe descends upon mankind,
and reappears at its close, is the welcome symbol
that the weary ages of sin and sorrow are at an end for
ever, that all tears shall be wiped from off all faces, that
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
for all the bitter past is over, and the former things
are now for ever passed away.</p>

<p>The sacred tree of the Assyrians, so often seen in the
sculptures from Nineveh and Kyonjik, the idolatrous
groves of the Israelites, the Hindu tree worship, all
point to a most interesting symbolism that would be out
of place in our present pages, but that will afford matter
of the deepest interest to those who care to work the
subject out.</p>

<p>Our readers will no doubt remember the reference
in Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey to the Lotophagi, the people who
eat of the lotus-tree, and in so doing forgot their friends
and homes in their far-off land, losing all desire to
return to their native shores, and caring for nought but
to rest in ease in the benumbing pleasures of Lotus-land.</p>

<p>The immortal Amaranth, &ldquo;a flower which once in
Paradise, fast by the tree of life, began to bloom, but
soon for man&rsquo;s offence to Heaven removed,&rdquo; must not
be omitted from our pages. Clement of Alexandria
refers to it as the <i>Amarantus flos, symbolum immortalitatis</i>,
and it was thus received for centuries. The name
is from the Greek word for immortal, and was bestowed
upon it from its never-withering flowers of ruby red.
Felicia Hemans, amongst others, refers to it in her fine
poem on &ldquo;Elysium:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>The passage in our New Testament translated &ldquo;A

Greek &ldquo;The amaranthine crown of glory.&rdquo; Milton is
frequently found to use the word; it occurs several times
in the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo; The following fine passage

<p>The Egyptians wreathed their dead in chaplets of the
sacred lotus to prepare their spirits for entrance into the

were also employed, but whether their employment
was symbolic or not we have no means of ascertaining.</p>

the large Museum at Kew, will be found&mdash;though thousands
tramp by them unknowingly&mdash;what we may almost
venture to call some of the most wonderful things in the
world. They are but chaplets, wreaths, and garlands of
dried leaves and flowers, until presently we realise that we
are gazing on memorials of the dead that were buried with
them more than a thousand years before the Christian
era. The imagination is then awed as our thoughts attempt
to bridge over the interval of two thousand years between
these present days and that far-off morning in the childhood
of the world when the beautiful fresh flowers of
the blue lotus of the Nile were placed in the coffin of
Rameses II. Almost all the history of the world has
been made since those fragile emblems of passing beauty
were laid in the tomb. Empires and monarchies have
risen, flourished, and decayed in the interval, and yet

<p>The Asphodel, referred to by Homer and many later
poets, was a plant having edible roots that were laid in
the tombs of the dead to nourish the departed spirit in
its wanderings in the dim world of shadows. Lucian
has a very good illustrative passage that we may here
quote. The words are put into the mouth of Charon, and
are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Down here with us there is nothing
to be had but asphodel, and libations and oblations,
and that in the midst of mist and darkness; but up in
heaven it is all bright and clear, and plenty of ambrosia
there, and nectar without stint.&rdquo; The plant referred to
by the classic poets was supposed to be the narcissus, but
in medi&aelig;val days the wild daffodil was intended, at least
by the poets, while the herbalists were all at sea in the
matter, and applied the name to several different plants.</p>

<p>Gerarde, in his &ldquo;Historie of Plants,&rdquo; refers to Galen
as an authority, quoting from his &ldquo;Faculties of Nourishments&rdquo;
in defence of the plant he selects, but does not
seem to have heard of the old belief in its forming a
food for the immortals, and can indeed give it no higher
effect in staying the ravages of time and decay than that
&ldquo;the ashes of this Bulbe mixed with oile and hens
grease cureth the falling of the haire.&rdquo; Parkinson, in
his &ldquo;Theatrum Botanicum,&rdquo; brings the plant down to a
still lower level, and not only sees no poetry in it, but
rather more than hints at a fraud, for he says&mdash;&ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
countrey people know no other name thereof or propertie
appropriate unto it but knavery, which, whether they
named it so in knavery, or knew any use of knavery
in it, I neither can learn nor am much inquisitive
thereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may here remark parenthetically that the old
herbals are full of the most delightfully quaint reading,
and are often freely illustrated with pictures at least as
curious, the frontispieces especially being of the most
elaborate and allegorical nature. The &ldquo;Rariorum Plantarum
Historia&rdquo; of Clusius is now before us as we write,
and we learn from its title-page that it was published at
Antwerp in the year 1601. We have Adam on one side,
in the simplicity of costume of Eden&rsquo;s earliest days, and
on the other Solomon, with crown and royal robes and
sceptre, bearing in his hands a book. Adam is claimed by
the medi&aelig;val herbalists as not only a tiller of the ground,
but also as a student of botanical science, while Solomon,
we all remember, wrote a treatise that dealt with
plants, from the lordly cedar to the lowly hyssop of the
wall. Above Adam, in a pot, is a Turk&rsquo;s-cap lily, and
by his side is the fritillary, while Solomon has associated
with him the cyclamen and the crown imperial. The
illustrations in the body of the book are very numerous
and quaint, and, though the book, it will be remembered,
is a history of rare plants, include such common things
as the marsh marigold, the bindweed, and the yellow
loosestrife. Clusius, or Charles d&rsquo;Ecluse, to give him
his true name, was a Dutch botanist, born 1526, died
1609. He was for some time the director of the Botanical
Garden at Vienna, and afterwards the Professor of
Botany at Leyden University, where he died.</p>

<p>The Herbal published by Matthiolus at Venice in the
year 1633 is a particularly fine book. The illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
are very large, very numerous, and very good. Another
interesting book to see is that of Dodoens, translated
by Henry Lyte, &ldquo;Armigeri, Somersetensis, Angli.&rdquo; The
title-page of our copy of the work runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;A
Nievve Herball, or Historie of Plantes: vvherein is contayned
the vvhole discourse and perfect description of
all sortes of Herbes and Plantes: their diuers and sundry
kindes: their straunge Figures, Fashions, and Shapes:
their Names, Natures, Operations, and Vertues: and
that not onely of those whiche are here growyng in this
our Countrie of Englande but of all others also of
forrayne Realmes commonly vsed in Physicke. First
set foorth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue, by that
learned D. Rembert Dodoens, Physition to the Emperour,
and nowe first translated out of French into
English, by Henry Lyte, Esquyer. At London by me
Gerard Dewes, dwelling in Pawles Churchyarde at the
signe of the Swanne, 1578.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still earlier in time is &ldquo;The Vertuose Boke of Distyllacyon
of the waters of all maner of Herbes, first compyled
by Jherom Bruynswyke, and now newly translated
out of Duyche, by Lawrence Andrew,&rdquo; the edition before
us being published in London in the year 1527.</p>

<p>In 1551 we find the first appearance of Turner&rsquo;s Herbal,
a book that was for a long time a standard authority. It
is divided into three sections&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) &ldquo;A New Herball, wherein are conteyned the
names of Herbes in Greke, Latin, Englysh, Duch,
Frenche, and in the Potecaries and Herbaries Latin,
with the properties, degrees, and naturall places of the
same, gathered and made by Wylliam Turner, Physicion
unto the Duke of Somersettes Grace, imprinted at
London, by Steven Mierdman, Anno 1551.</p>

<p>(2.) A Book of the natures and properties as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
of the bathes of England as of other bathes in Germany
and Italy, etc., by William Turner, Doctor of Physik,
imprinted at Collen, by Arnold Birckman, in the year
of our Lorde, MDLXII.</p>

<p>(3.) A most excellent and perfecte homish apothecarye,
etc., translated out of the Almaine Speche into
English, by John Hollybush, imprinted at Collen by
Arnold Birckman, MDLXI.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter part of this &ldquo;homely physick booke for all
the grefes and diseases of the bodye&rdquo; was really the
work, so far at least as translation went, of Miles Coverdale,
the notable divine and translator of the Bible,
Hollybush being merely a pseudonym.</p>

<p>The only other quaint old tome that we need here
refer to, though, of course, it must be clearly understood
that we have named but a few of the delightful old books
on plant-lore that have come down to us, is the somewhat
specialised work of Newton. Its title is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Herbal for the Bible, containing a plaine and
familiar exposition of such Similitudes, Parables, and
Metaphors, both in the Olde Testament and the Newe,
as are borrowed and taken from Herbs, Plants, Trees,
Fruits, and Simples, by observation of their vertues,
qualities, natures, properties, operations and effects: and
by the Holie Prophets, Sacred Writers, Christ Himselfe,
and His blessed Apostles usually alledged, and into their
heauenly Oracles, for the better beautifieng and plainer
opening of the same, profitably inserted. Drawen into
English by Thomas Newton, imprinted at London by
Edmund Bollifant, 1587.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ambrosia often referred to by the old writers and
by more modern poets was originally the food of the gods,
nectar being the drink. It is in this sense referred to by
Homer and Ovid, though afterwards the two ingredients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
of the Olympian bill of fare became a good deal confused
together; thus in the beautiful fable of Cupid and
Psyche, in the &ldquo;Golden Ass&rdquo; of Apuleius, we find Jupiter
conferred on Psyche the gift of immortality by giving
her a cup of ambrosia to drink. The term was also
sometimes used as descriptive of anything delicious to the
taste, fragrant in perfume, or welcome to the eye, from
the idea that whatever was used by the immortals, associated
with them as an attribute, or that would be grateful
in any way to them must be surpassingly excellent.
Thus we read in the Iliad of the &ldquo;ambrosial curls&rdquo; of
Zeus, a somewhat extreme case of departure from the
ordinarily limited sense in which the word was most
commonly used.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> As the word ambrosia means literally
&ldquo;not mortal,&rdquo; it could evidently in this more extended
sense be applied by Homer with perfect propriety to the
curls or aught else that pertained to the ruler of Olympus.</p>

<p>In the South Kensington Museum may be seen a
picture by Francis Danby, bearing the title of &ldquo;The
Upas-tree of the Island of Java.&rdquo; The whole picture is
exceedingly dark, but one can just discern in the centre
of it the form of a tree, and around this are human
bodies and skeletons. The myth of the upas has been
created on the very smallest data, and furnishes a striking
example of how great a structure of error, not to say
gross and wilful exaggeration, can be reared on a basis
of truth. The neighbourhood of the tree is unhealthy,
not on account of anything in the tree itself, but because
it grows in the hot and humid valleys of Java, rank with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
malaria and fever. A Dutch physician, named Foersch,
published in 1783 a narrative of his visit to the island,
and amongst his wild statements we find that where the
upas grows &ldquo;not a tree or blade of grass is to be found
in the valley or the surrounding mountains, not a bird,
beast, reptile, or living thing lives in its neighbourhood.&rdquo;
He adds that &ldquo;on one occasion 1600 refugees encamped
within fourteen miles of it, and all but 300 died within
two months:&rdquo; this might easily arise from the malarial
vapours, but his picture of the tree standing in the midst
of the desolation it had itself created is utterly at variance
with the facts. So entirely do the actual facts belie
the legend that nothing prospers in its neighbourhood,
it is found in the midst of the rich vegetation of the
tropics, while the birds perch in its ample branches, and
the wild beasts prowl beneath them. So far is it from
being the case, to quote one of our own poets, that
&ldquo;Fierce in dead silence on the blasted heath fell upas
sits, the hydra tree of death,&rdquo;&mdash;the last relic of the marvellous
is gone, when we recall the fact that thousands
of holiday-makers have passed harmlessly through the
hothouses at Kew, where a specimen of the plant may
be seen, and that the refugees from London more or
less permanently encamped within a mile or two of it
have so far escaped damage from its proximity. The
Upas belongs to the same family as the invaluable bread-fruit
and cow-tree, but, instead of possessing their beneficent
properties, yields, when wounded, a thick milky fluid
of a very poisonous nature, and which is employed by the
natives on their arrows and spear-heads with deadly effect.</p>

<p>The first published account of the Upas-tree will be
found in De Brys &ldquo;India Orientalis,&rdquo; but the scanty
particulars of the earlier author become considerably
amplified in Sir Thomas Herbert&rsquo;s book of travels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
published in London in the year 1634, and entitled
&ldquo;Relations of some yeares Travaile.&rdquo; A little later
on, in 1688, we find the tree again referred to in the
&ldquo;Description historique du Royaume de Maca&ccedil;ar&rdquo; of
Father Gervaise. The author, who had really resided in
Macassar for several years, affirms that the mere touch or
smell of some of the poisons produced by the natives is
sufficient to produce death, and one of the most deadly
of these was said by him to be produced from the sap of
the Upas. He tells us that arrows dipped in this juice
were as fatal in their effects twenty years afterwards as
at their first preparation. In K&oelig;mpfer&rsquo;s book, published
in the year 1712, we have the plant again described; a
large mixture of fable is at once apparent, but much of
this he gives on the authority of the natives, and he takes
occasion to express his strong doubts of their veracity.
According to him, or them, the collection of the sap is
attended with imminent peril, for not only must the
seeker after the tree penetrate far into places infested
with wild beasts, but he must, when he has found the
object of his search, be careful to pierce it on the side
from whence the wind blows, or he would quickly be
suffocated by the noxious effluvia given forth when the
tree is wounded.</p>

Apart from the evil influence exerted on Europeans
by climatic and miasmatic drawbacks, the mountain of
mystery that has been reared around the dread name
of Upas has but little foundation in fact. Its juice is
very plentifully yielded, and is of a virulently poisonous
character, and even its smell is injurious. In clearing
ground near the Upas the natives dread to approach it
on this account; but unless the trunk is severely wounded
or the tree felled the injurious effects are in the imagination
only, and the tree may be approached or ascended
with impunity. The Upas is one of the largest of the
forest trees of Java, and it is surrounded as other trees
are with the usual sturdy vegetation of the tropical
wilderness.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Parker, a well-known missionary in
Madagascar, gives a description of two trees that recall
in their detail much that has hitherto in an especial
degree been ascribed to the Upas. In both these species
the leaf is spear-head shaped, dark green in colour,
very glossy in surface, and very hard and brittle to the
touch, and both exude a thick milky juice, while the
fruit is like a long black pod, the end being red. One
species is a tree with large leaves and a somewhat
peculiar stem, as the bark hangs down in long flakes and
shows a fresh growth of bark forming beneath and preparing
to take the place of the old bark as it falls. The
other species is a shrub, with smaller leaves, and the
bark not peeling off the stem. Both species are said to
possess the power of poisoning any living creatures that
approach them, the symptoms of poisoning being severe
headache, bloodshot eyes, and a delirium that is presently
hushed in death. These trees are natives of
Zululand, and only a few persons are believed to have the
power of collecting the fruits of the Umdhlebi, and these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
dare not approach the tree except from the windward
side. They also sacrifice a goat or sheep to the demon
of the tree. The fruit is collected for the purpose of
being used as an antidote to the poisonous effects of the
tree from whence they fall, for only the fallen fruit may
be collected. As regards habitat, these trees grow on all
kinds of soil, but the tree-like species prefers barren
and rocky ground. In consequence of the fears of the
natives the country around one of these trees is always
uninhabited, although in other respects fertile and
desirable.</p>

<p>In Persia, we are told, there is a plant, the Kerzereh
flower, that loads the air with deathly odour, and that if
a man inhales the hot south wind that passes over these
flowers during June and July it kills him. Moore, in his
Poem of &ldquo;The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan,&rdquo; alludes to
this belief in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>The Mandrake, a plant belonging to the same natural
order as the deadly nightshade, henbane, and thorn-apple,
had in the Middle Ages many mystic properties
assigned to it. The roots are often forked, and when
either by nature or art they could be supposed to roughly
resemble a man it was looked upon as a talisman securing
good fortune to its possessor. The belief in the narcotic
and stupefying properties of the plant is referred to in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>The victories of the Maid of Orleans over the English
were ascribed to her possession of a mandrake root.
Gerarde, writing in the year 1633, says that the root is
long and thick, and divided into two or three parts;
but as to its resemblance to a man, &ldquo;it is no otherwise
than in the roots of carrots, parsnips and such like forked
or divided into two or more parts, which nature taketh
no account of. There hath been many ridiculous tales
brought up of this plant, whether of old wiues or some
runnagate Surgeons or physicke-mongers I know not, but
sure some one or more that sought to make themselves
famous and skilful aboue others were the first broachers
of that error. They adde further, that it is never or very
seldome to be found growing naturally but under a
gallows.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> They fable further and affirme that he who
would take vp a plant thereof must tie a dog there unto
to pull it up, which will giue a great shreeke at the
digging vp, otherwise if a man should do it he should
surely die in short space after. All of which dreames
and old wiues fables you shall from henceforth cast out
from your books and memory, knowing this that they are
all and euery part of them false and most untrue, for I
my selfe and my seruants also have digged up, planted
and replanted very many and yet could neuer perceiue
shape of man. But the idle drones that have little or
nothing to do but to eat and drink have bestowed some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
of their time in carving the roots of Brionie, which
falsifying practice had confirmed the errour amongst the
simple and unlearned people who haue taken them upon
their report to be the true Mandrakes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Parkinson in
like manner, in his &ldquo;Theater of Plants,&rdquo; published in
1640, writes, after describing the plant:&mdash;&ldquo;Those idle
forms of the mandrakes which have beene exposed to view
publikely both in ours and other lands and countries are
utterly deceitful, being the work of cuning knaves, onely
to get money by their forgery: do not misdoubt of this
relation no more than you would of any other plant set
downe in this booke, for it is the plaine truth whereon
everyone may relie.&rdquo; The cry of the mandrake is several
times referred to by Shakespeare and others of our poets;
thus in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; we get the line&mdash;</p>

<p>It was believed that a small dose of the mandrake
made persons proud of their beauty, but that a larger
quantity deprived them of their senses still more completely,
and made them yet more effectually idiots.</p>

<p>Dr. Browne, in his gallant crusade against popular
errors, says that the resemblance of the mandrake to
the human form &ldquo;is a conceit not to be made out by
ordinary inspection, or any other eyes than such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
regarding the clouds behold them in shapes conformable
to pre-apprehension;&rdquo; and as to the danger of gathering
the plant, he justly holds it &ldquo;a conceit not only injurious
unto truth and confutable by daily experience, but somewhat
derogatory to the providence of God: That is, not
only to impose so destructive a quality on any plant, but
conceive a vegetable whose parts are useful unto many
should in the only taking up prove mortall unto any. To
think he suffereth the poison of Nubia to be gathered,
yet not this to be moved! That he permitteth arsenick
and minerall poisons to be forced from the bowells of
the earth, yet not this from the surface thereof! This
were to introduce a second forbidden fruit and inhance
the first malediction; making it not only mortal for
Adam to taste the one, but capitall unto his posterity to
eradicate the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orthodox way of plucking up the mandrake was
to stand to the windward of it and, after drawing three
circles round it with a naked sword to dig it up with
one&rsquo;s face looking to the west; the shrieks that would
follow were in any case a trial to weak nerves, and at
an earlier period were held to be fatal to the hearer.
Philip de Thaun gives the following stratagem as the
only available way of becoming the possessor of it:&mdash;&ldquo;The
man who is to gather it must fly round about it,
must take great care that he does not touch it, then
let him take a dog and let it be tied to it, which has
been close shut up, and has fasted for three days, and
let it be shewn bread and called from afar. The dog
will draw it to him, the root will break, it will send forth
a cry, and the dog will fall down dead at the cry which
he will hear. Such vertue this herb has that no one can
hear it but he must always die, and if the man heard it
he would directly die. Therefore he must stop his ears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
and take care that he hear not the cry lest he die, as the
dog will do which shall hear it. When one has this root
it is of great value for medicine, for it cures of every
infirmity except only death, where there is no help.&rdquo;
The office of the herbalist was no sinecure when such a
task could be expected of him, as great care had to be
exercised not to touch the plant. The tying-up of the dog
to it must have been particularly risky, and the consequences
of the dog making a premature rush for the
bread before the man had time to stop his ears were
especially alarming. The writings of De Thaun are full
of interesting matter, but his great object was to see in
nature figures and symbols of religious truths, hence his
narratives have often a somewhat forced character. Thus
he tells us that &ldquo;in India there is a tree of which the
fruit is so sweet that the doves of the earth go seeking it
above all things, they eat the fruit of it, seat themselves
in the tree, they are in repose as long as they are sheltered
by it. There is a dragon in the earth which makes war
on the birds; the dragon fears so much the tree, that on
no acconnt dare it approach it or touch the shadow, but
it goes round at a distance, and, if it can, does them
injury. If the shadow is to the right then it goes to the
left, if it is to the left the dragon goes to the right. The
doves have so much understanding which are above in
the tree when they see the dragon go all around, which
goes watching them, but it does them no harm, nor will
they ever have any harm as long as they are in the tree,
but when they leave the tree and depart, and the dragon
shall come then, it will kill them. This is a great meaning,
have it in remembrance.&rdquo; This Indian tree stands
not obscurely for the Saviour of the world, while the
doves are His faithful ones sheltered in Him from the
wiles of the Evil One. When we read story after story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
all equally <i>apropos</i>, we cannot help feeling that a pious
fraud has now and then been indulged in, and the comely
whole has been attained by a little judicious pruning in
one direction, and a little forcing in another, and thus
we lose faith in them, at least as examples of the current
beliefs of our forefathers.</p>

<p>The Arabs call the mandrake the devil&rsquo;s candle, from
a belief that the leaves give out at night a phosphorescent
light; and Moore, with his usual felicity, has introduced
the idea in his poem of the &ldquo;Fire-Worshippers:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<p>Another old name for the plant was the Enchanter&rsquo;s
nightshade, though that very suggestive and rather awe-inspiring
title has in these later days become somehow
transferred to a very insignificant weed that is common
enough in some old gardens and on waste ground, but
which is all too small to bear so formidable a title.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word <i>Dudaim</i> has, in Genesis and in the
Song of Solomon, been translated in the Authorised
English Version of the Bible as the mandrake, but this
would appear to be nothing more than a guess, various
commentators, Calmet, Hasselquist, and others who have
written on the subject, not being by any means unanimous.
Some tell us that the term is a general one for
flowers, while others translate it as lilies, violets, or jessamine,
or as figs, mushrooms, bananas, citrons, or melons.
Whence we may fairly conclude that no one really knows,
and that the whole matter resolves itself into a guess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
fortified more or less by dogmatic assertion as a make-weight
for the missing knowledge.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the old books on our
shelves is the &ldquo;Miracles of Art and Nature, or a Brief
Description of the several varieties of Birds, Beasts,
Fishes, Plants and Fruits of other Countreys, together
with several other Remarkable Things in the World, By
R.&nbsp;B. Gent.&rdquo; The author&rsquo;s name thus modestly veiled
is Burton, and the date of the book is 1678. In his
preface he says&mdash;&ldquo;I think there is not a chapter wherein
thou wilt not find various and remarkable things worth
thy observation,&rdquo; and this observation of his is strictly
within the truth. He arranges his short chapters geographically,
but in the most arbitrary way&mdash;not alphabetically,
not according to the natural grouping together of
the countries of which he treats, nor indeed according
to any settled method. In fact, he is sufficiently conscious
of this, for, to quote his preface again, he says&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
probable they are <em>not</em> so Methodically disposed as some
hands might have done, yet for Variety and pleasure
sake they are pleasingly enough intermixed.&rdquo; We open
the book at random and find &ldquo;Chap. XX., Castile in
Spain; XXI., Norway; XXII., Zisca of Bohemia; XXIII.,
Assiria; XXIV., Quivira in California.&rdquo; Adopting his
own random and haphazard way of going to work, we
will pluck from his quaint pages some few of his botanical
facts and fancies. His opening chapter deals with
Egypt, and in his description of the palm-tree he refers
to a very old belief that we may allow him to set forth in
his own words:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the nature of this tree though
never so ponderous a weight were put upon it not to
yield to the burthen, but still to resist the heaviness,
and endeavour to raise itself the more upward. For this
cause planted in Churchyards in the Eastern Countrys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
as an Emblem of the Resurrection.&rdquo; A little further on,
in his description of Sumatra, we read of &ldquo;a tree whose
Western part is said to be rank poyson and the Eastern
part an excellent preservative against it,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;a sort
of Fruit that whosoever eateth of it, is for the space
of twelve hours out of his Wits.&rdquo; Travellers&rsquo; tales have
sometimes proverbially been difficult of belief, and it
must have been some such as these that procured them
their evil report, for we read too that in this same island
&ldquo;there is a river plentifully stored with Fish, whose
Water is so hot that it scalds the skin,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
cocks have a hole in their backs, wherein the Hen lays
her Eggs and hatches her young ones.&rdquo; A few pages
further on we read of a tree in Peru, &ldquo;the North part
whereof looking towards the Mountains, brings forth its
Fruits in the Summer only; the Southern part looking
towards the Sea, fruitful only in Winter.&rdquo; Our old
author evidently delights in sharp contrasts. It is curious,
however, that the Coca-leaf, which has within the last
few years been highly commended for those who have
exhausting exercise, is in this book of over 200 years
old fully referred to:&mdash;&ldquo;The leaves whereof being dried
and formed into little pellets are exceedingly useful in
a Journey; for melting in the mouth they satisfie both
hunger and thirst and preserve a man in his strength,
and his Spirits in Vigour; and are generally esteemed
of such sovereign use, that it is thought no less than
100,000 Baskets full of the leaves of this tree are sold
yearly at the Mines of Potosia only. Another plant they
tell us of, though there is no name found for it, which if
put into the hands of a sick person will instantly discover
whether he be like to live or dye. For if on the
pressing it in his hand he look merry and cheerful it is
an assured sign of his recovery, as on the other side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
Death, if sad and troubled.&rdquo; A few pages further on we
find ourselves at Sodom and the Dead Sea:&mdash;&ldquo;If but an
Aple grow near it, it is by Nature such that it speaks the
Anger of God: for without &rsquo;tis beautiful and Red, but
within nothing but dusty Smoak and Cinders.&rdquo; This
belief is a very ancient one. We find it, for instance, in
the writings of Tacitus, and it has supplied moralists
in all ages with an illustration. In &ldquo;The Merchant of
Venice,&rdquo; for instance, we find the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>and again in &ldquo;Childe Harold&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Like to the apples on the Dead Sea&rsquo;s shore, all ashes to the taste.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The apple has indeed entered largely into history and
legend. According to some writers the forbidden fruit
of Eden was a kind of apple, and the <i>pomum Adami</i> in
one&rsquo;s throat may be accepted as a record of the old
belief. &ldquo;The fruit of that forbidden tree, whose mortal
taste brought death into the world, and all our woe.&rdquo;
Our readers, too, will recall the golden apple of discord
that created strife alike on high Olympus and amongst
the sons of men, and that led to the fall of Troy. On
the other hand, we read of the apple of perpetual youth
in Scandinavian mythology, the food of the gods; and
in the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; of the apples of Samarkand
that would cure all diseases. The apples of Istkahar
were all sweetness on one side, all bitterness on the
other; while Sir John Mandeville tells us that the pigmies
were fed with the odour alone of the apples of Pyban.
Amidst this maze of fancy and legend it would perhaps
be scarcely fair to even mention the more historic apple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
that fell at Woolsthorpe at the feet of Newton, and set

We remember some time ago an interesting article by Dr. Adolf
Dux, entitled &ldquo;La tombe du Savant&rdquo; appearing in the &ldquo;Pester Lloyd.&rdquo;
The savant was Bolyai, professor of mathematics and physics at Maros-V&aacute;s&aacute;rhely.
No statue, no marble mausoleum with sides covered with
laudatory inscriptions, marks the place where he lies, but the tomb, by
its occupant&rsquo;s strict direction, is overshadowed by the boughs of an apple-tree&mdash;&ldquo;En

Dr. Dux visited the tomb there hung on the tree just three apples&mdash;&ldquo;ni

<p>At Crete our old author, Burton, finds a plant called
Alimos, which it is only necessary to chew to take away
all sense of hunger for a whole day; but this wonder
pales before those of the flora of Nova Hispania, the
country we now call Mexico. &ldquo;Amongst the Rarities
of Nova Hispania, though there be many Plants in it
of Singuler Nature, is mentioned that which they call
Eagney or Meto, said to be one of the principal: a Tree
which they both Plant and Dress as we do our Vines; it
hath on it 40 kinds of leaves, fit for several uses; for
when they be tender they make of them Conserves, Paper,
Flax, Mantles, Mats, Shoes, Girdles and Cordage, upon
them they grow divers prickles so strong and sharp that
the people use them instead of Staws.&rdquo; What Staws
may be we cannot say, so we must be content to know
that Meto thorns make a very efficient substitute, and are
for all practical purposes as good as having the real thing.
&ldquo;From the top of the Tree cometh a Juice like Syrrup,
which if you Seeth it will become Honey; if purified,
Sugar; the Bark of it maketh a good plaister and from
the highest of the Boughs comes a kind of Gum, a
Soveraigne Antidote against poysons.&rdquo; The tree furnishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
at once costume and confection, antidote and rope, and
we can hardly wonder at the people of New Spain setting
considerable store by it.</p>

<p>It would be curious to see the forms of the forty leaves;
we can well imagine that a plant suggesting about equally
by its foliage the rose, palm, bullrush, buttercup, cactus,
horse-chestnut, and thirty-four other plants would give
our botanists some little difficulty before it got definitely
assigned its just place.</p>

<p>Brazil, like Mexico, is a very large place, and a very
long way off, and two hundred years ago the Royal Mail
Steam-Packet Company was a thing of the far future;
there was therefore abundant room for play of the
imagination; thus we read of a kind of corn &ldquo;which is
continually growing and always ripe; nor never wholly
ripe, because always growing;&rdquo; and of another plant that
yields so sovereign a balm that &ldquo;the very beasts being
bitten by venomous Serpents resort to it for their cure.&rdquo;
It is interesting, amongst the other strange wonders,
animal and vegetable, that are duly set forth, to come
across a plant that must be very familiar to most persons,
the sensitive plant, the <i>Mimosa sensitiva</i> of Brazil, though
in his description of it our author cannot resist an added
touch of the marvellous, imputing to it a power of
observation that later writers would hesitate to confirm,
for he says&mdash;&ldquo;The herb Viva when roughly touched will
close the leaves, and not open them again until the man
that had offended it had got out of sight.&rdquo; We must
not, however, devote more attention to &ldquo;R.&nbsp;B. Gent,&rdquo;
great as the temptation to do so may be, for his book is
a perfect mine of the marvellous. Another curious old
book to ponder over awhile is the English Dictionary
of Henry Cockeram, as he certainly produces some extraordinary
illustrations of unnatural history. The book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
was published in the year 1655, and did not profess to
deal with scientific matters alone, but was, to use the
author&rsquo;s own language, &ldquo;an interpreter of hard English
words, enabling as well ladies and gentlewomen, young
scholars, clerks, merchants, as also strangers of any nation,
to the understanding of the more difficult authors already
printed in our language, and the more speedy attaining of
an elegant perfection of the English tongue.&rdquo; Amongst
these hard English words sadly needing an interpretation
we will select but five as a sample of the whole:&mdash;&ldquo;Achemedis,
an herb which being cast into an army in
time of battle causeth the soldiers to be in fear.&rdquo; This
probably would be some kind of runner. &ldquo;Anacramseros,
an herb, the touch thereof causeth love to grow betwixt
man and man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hippice, an herb borne in one&rsquo;s
mouth, keeps one from hunger and thirst.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ophyasta,
an herb dangerous to look on, and being drunke it doth
terrifie the inside with a sight of dreadful serpents, that
condemned persons for fear thereof do kill themselves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gelotaphilois, an herb drunk with wine and myrrh,
causeth much laughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amidst the mist of error some few men declined to
believe quite all that they were told, but exercised for
themselves the right of individual judgment. The book
we have just referred to was published, as we have seen,
in the year 1655, and abounds in strange imaginings;
yet five years before this we find a still better-known
book, &ldquo;the Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into
very many Received Tenants and commonly Presumed
Truths&rdquo; of Dr. Browne. The list of commonly presumed
truths he ventures to dispute is a very long one,
and includes such items of faith as that a diamond is
made soft if placed in the blood of a goat, that a pailful
of ashes will contain as much water as it would without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
them, that the two legs on one side of a badger are
shorter than the two on the other side, and so on. As
he approaches the vegetable kingdom he prefaces his
remarks as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We omit to recite the many vertues
and endlesse faculties ascribed unto plants which sometimes
occurre in grave and serious authors, and we shall
make a bad transaction for Truth to concede a verity in
half. Swarms of others there are, some whereof our
future endeavours may discover; common reason I hope
will save us a labour in many whose absurdities stand
naked in every eye, errors not able to deceive the Emblem
of Justice and need no Argus to descry them. Herein
there surely wants expurgatory animadversions whereby
we might strike out great numbers of hidden qualities,
and having once a serious and conceded list we might
with more encouragement and safety attempt their
Reasons.&rdquo; On turning to the list of &ldquo;vertues&rdquo; in any
old Herbal, we find, as Browne says, &ldquo;endlesse faculties
ascribed, and many of them of a character that woulde
we should have imagined have been, during even the
darkest ages, difficult or impossible of credence.&rdquo; Thus
in Gerarde&rsquo;s herbal published in 1633, we find amongst
our British plants one available &ldquo;against the biting of the
Sea-dragon,&rdquo; two more &ldquo;a remedy against the poyson of the
Sea-hare,&rdquo; one &ldquo;against vaine imaginations,&rdquo; another &ldquo;an
especial remedy against the nightmare,&rdquo; and no less than
thirty-eight preservatives &ldquo;against the bitings of serpents.&rdquo;
We will, however, confine ourselves to three illustrative instances
of the way in which the author of these inquiries
into various received beliefs proceeds to demolish them.
He says, in the first place, that &ldquo;many things are delivered
and believed of plants wherein at least we cannot but
suspend. That there is a property in Basil to propagate
scorpions and that by the smell thereof they are bred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
in the brains of men is a belief much advanced by
Hollerius, who found this insect in the brains of a man
that delighted much in this smell. Wherein besides that
we finde no way to conjoin the effect unto the cause
assigned herein the moderns speak but timorously, and
some of the Ancients quite contrarily. For according
unto Oribasius, physitian unto Julian, the Africans, men
best experienced in poisons, affirm whosoever hath eaten
Basil although he be stung with a Scorpion shall feel
no pain thereby; which is a very different effect, and
rather antidotally destroying than promoting its production.&rdquo;
Pliny and other ancient writers mention the old
belief that the bay-tree, the tree of Apollo, was a preservative
against thunder, or rather against lightning; hence
Tiberius and some other of the Roman Emperors wore
a wreath of bay as an amulet; and in an old English play
we find the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">&ldquo;Reach the bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ll tie a garland here about his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Twill keep my boy from lightning.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browne discourses on the point as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That Bayes
will protect from the mischief of lightning and thunder
is a quality ascribed thereto, common with the fig tree,
eagle and skin of a seale. Against so famous a quality
Vicomercatus produceth experiments of a Bay-tree blasted
in Italy, and therefore although Tiberius for this interest
did wear a Laurell about his temples yet did Augustus
take a more probable course, who fled under arches and
hollow vaults for protection.&rdquo; A most unimperial picture
this, great C&aelig;sar deserting his throne and shutting himself
up in his wine-cellar when he heard the distant
rumbling of the coming storm. &ldquo;If we consider the
three-fold effect of Jupiter&rsquo;s Trisulk, to burn, discusse,
and terebrate, and if that be true which is commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
delivered, that it will melt the blade yet passe the
scabbard, dry up the wine yet leave the hog&rsquo;s head
entire, though it favour the amulet it may not spare
us; it will be unwise to rely on any preservative, &rsquo;tis no
security to be dipped in Styx or clad in the armour of
Ceneus.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>There are many curious legends associated with plants
in classic mythology, such as the metamorphoses of various
lucky or unlucky persons who gained the favour or incurred
the wrath of the gods, and were in consequence
punished or rewarded by finding themselves laurel-bushes
and the like; but all this is duly set forth in any mythological
dictionary, and may be there hunted up quite
readily by the curious.</p>

<p>Other legends are associated with religious symbolism,
such as the belief that the palm-tree cannot be bowed
down to earth, but stands erect, no matter how heavily
weighted; but if we were once to enter upon this most
interesting subject, the preceding pages of our book
would be but a small fragment indeed of all that it would
be possible to introduce.</p>

<a name="palm" id="palm"></a>
<img src="images/ml12.jpg" width="350" height="330"
alt="The palm-tree" />
</div>

<p>A very good illustration of the symbolic use of the
palm-tree may be seen on the frontispiece of the &ldquo;Eikon
Basilike,&rdquo; published in the year 1648. The &ldquo;Royal
Martyr&rdquo; kneels before a table on which is placed a
Bible. In his hand he has taken a crown of thorns,
marked &ldquo;Gratia;&rdquo; at his feet is the royal crown of
England, with the inscription &ldquo;Vanitas,&rdquo; while in the
air above him is a starry crown marked &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo; Outside
the room we see a landscape. Conspicuous in the
foreground is a palm-tree standing erect with two heavy
weights tied to it, and the legend, &ldquo;Crescit sub pondere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
virtus;&rdquo; while beyond this is a raging sea and a rock
rising from its midst, with the legend, &ldquo;Immota triumphans.&rdquo;
The sky is black with rolling clouds, and on
either side of the rock we see dark faces in the clouds
blowing vehemently against it. Beneath is the &ldquo;Explanation
of the Embleme&rdquo; in two columns, the one
Latin and the other in the vulgar tongue. The English
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though clogged with weights of miseries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palm-like depressed I higher rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as th&rsquo; immoved Rock outbraves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boist&rsquo;rous Windes and raging waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So triumph I. And shine more bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sad Affliction&rsquo;s Darksom night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Splendid, but yet toilsom Crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regardlessly I trample down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joie I take this Crown of Thorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sharp yet easie to be born.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That Heavenlie Crown, already mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I view with eies of Faith Divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I slight vain things and do embrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorie, the just reward of Grace.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This belief in the impossibility of depriving the palm-tree
of its power of upward growth made it a rather
popular emblem with those who thought themselves
rather &ldquo;put upon&rdquo; by fortune or the lack of appreciation
from their fellows. Mary Stuart, for example,
selected as one of her badges the palm-tree, with the
motto, &ldquo;Ponderibus virtus innata resistit,&rdquo; and other
illustrations of the old belief might readily be brought
forward.</p>

<p>As these plants, too, whether associated with mythology
or religious or other symbolism, are not in themselves
fabulous, but are actual laurels, palms, or the like, they
need scarcely be dwelt upon at any length in these
pages, as our purpose has been rather to deal with
forms wholly mythical than to enter with any degree of
fulness into the mythical beliefs that have grown round
forms in themselves natural.</p>

<p>We cannot, in conclusion, do better, we are sure, than
transfer bodily to our book the appeal to the reader
that appears on the title-page of a quaint little black-letter
treatise published in the year 1548&mdash;the &ldquo;Boke
of Husbandry&rdquo; by one Fitzherbert:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="appendixa" id="appendixa"></a>A.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life and death of St. George, as generally accepted, are
so different to the details given by Gibbon in his &ldquo;History of
the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&rdquo; that we give, as
a foil, a sketch of the latter as well. From Gibbon it would
appear that George, surnamed the Cappadocian, was born
in Cilicia in a fuller&rsquo;s shop, that he raised himself from this
obscure origin by his talents as a parasite, and that those
whom he so shamelessly flattered and assiduously fawned
on repaid their worthless dependent by procuring for him
lucrative contracts to supply the army with bacon and other
stores. Herein he accumulated, as some other army contractors
have done since, a vast sum of money by the basest
acts of fraud and corruption, until matters became so bad
and his shortcomings so notorious that he absconded with
his ill-gotten gains. After the disgrace attached to this had
in some measure subsided, we next find him embracing, with
real or affected zeal, the doctrines of Arianism, and on the
death of the Archbishop Athanasius the prevailing faction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
promoted the ex-contractor to the vacant chair. He had
scarcely been established in this high and responsible office
ere he sullied the dignity of his position by acts of the greatest
cruelty against those who differed from him, and by the
development anew of the keenest avarice. He asserted
for himself the right to various important monopolies, and
impoverished the State while he enriched himself by alone
supplying salt, paper, and various other necessaries. The
people at length rose in rebellion, and on the accession of
Julian he lost the high support that had hitherto, by aid of the
civil and military power of the State, maintained him in his
position. He was ignominiously dragged in chains to the
public prison, and the mob, impatient of the delays of the
law, or apprehensive that he might use his wealth and influence
to stifle inquiry, presently forced open the gates and tore
him to pieces. The Church was at that time an arena of fierce
dissension between the Arians and Athanasians, and his
followers, conveniently ignoring the facts of his life, asserted
that the rival party in the Church had stirred up the strife
against him. He received the just reward of his tyranny, or
possibly the saintly crown of the martyr for his faith, in the
year 361, and in 494 Pope Gelasius formally and officially
admitted his claim to a position amongst the saints of the
Church. We find him held in great reverence in the sixth
century in Palestine, Armenia, and Rome. His fame was
brought home from the East by the Crusaders, and his
popularity in England dates from that time. So much party
feeling has clustered around the matter, and so many learned
authorities have been drawn up on one side or the other,
that we can only feel that no real verdict one way or the
other is now possible.</p>

<h3><a name="appendixb" id="appendixb"></a>B.</h3>

<p>As we have already in the body of the text given in full
detail the accepted prose version of the conflict of St. George
with the dragon, it seemed scarcely advisable to repeat these
details in metrical form. As we feel, at the same time, that
such old ballads will probably possess interest for some, at
least, of our readers, we, instead of banishing the story from
our book entirely, dismiss it to the Appendix merely, where
it can be equally readily read or ignored in accordance with
individual tastes. The ballad, as given in Dr. Percy&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Reliques,&rdquo; is based on ancient black-letter copies in the
Pepys Collection. In the original the poem is forty-four
verses long, but we content ourselves with those that relate
to the combat with the dragon, and leave out those that
affect what may be termed the politics of the court, the
promise of the maiden to the hero, the subsequent endeavours
to evade the bargain, and the various consequences
to St. George and others that arose from this breach of
faith:&mdash;</p>

the natural history of Guillaume he points out that not only
was it difficult for these early writers to ascertain the truth,
but that the truth in its lower sense was not really much
striven after or valued. He says&mdash;&ldquo;N&rsquo;oublions pas que les

<p>&ldquo;The story of Guy is so obscured with fable that it is
difficult to ascertain its authenticity. He was the hero of
succeeding Earls of Warwick. William Beauchamp called
his eldest son after him. Thomas by his last will bequeathed
the sword and coat-of-mail of this worthy to his son.
Another christened a younger son after him, and dedicated
to him a noble tower, whose walls are ten feet thick, the
circumference 126, and the height 113 feet from the bottom
of the ditch. Another left as an heirloom to his family a
suit of arras wrought with his story. His sword and armour,
now to be seen in Warwick Castle, were by patent, 1 Henry
VIII., granted to William Hoggeson, yeoman of the battery,
with a fee of 2d. per day. In the porter&rsquo;s lodge at the castle
they still show his porridge-pot, flesh-fork, iron shield, breastplate
and sword, horse furniture, walking staff nine feet
high, and even a rib of the dun cow which he pretended to
have killed on Dunsmore Heath. In short, his fame and
spirit seem to have inspired his successors, for from the
Conquest to the death of Ambrose Dudley there was scarce
a scene of action in which the Earls of Warwick did not
make a considerable figure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Camden&rsquo;s Britannia</i>, vol.

<p>As the limited space at our disposal prevents anything
like an exhaustive account of the wonders narrated by
Mandeville and others, we give the titles of some few old
works, in case the reader may care to dive into them at
greater length than is here at all possible. The first we
would mention is Richard Hackluyt&rsquo;s black-letter folio,
published in 1589. Its full title runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Principal Navigations; Voiages and Discoveries of the
English Nation, made by Sea or over Land to the most
remote and farthest distant Quarters of the earth at any
time within the compasse of these 1500 yeeres.&rdquo; Another
is &ldquo;Purchas his Pilgrimage, or Relations of the World, Asia,
Africa and America and the Ilands adiacent,&rdquo; published in
London in the year 1614; a very quaint and interesting old
book. The &ldquo;Ortus Sanitatis&rdquo; is another very curious old
black-letter volume, dealing with animals, plants, &amp;c., and
richly illustrated with very remarkable woodcuts. To these
we may add Marco Polo&rsquo;s travels in the thirteenth century,
detailing the observations of this early traveller on many remarkable
places and things seen or heard of by him, chiefly
in the East. Struy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Perillous and most Unhappy Voyages
through Moscovia, Tartary, Italy, Greece, Persia, Japan,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
is another interesting old volume. It was published in the
year 1638, and is illustrated by divers curious plates. To
this list we need only add the &ldquo;Natvrall and Morall Historie
of the East and West Indies,&rdquo; by Joseph Acosta; 1604.
&ldquo;Intreating of the Remarkable things of Heaven, of the
Elements, Mettalls, Plants, and Beasts which are proper to
that Country.&rdquo; Where we have given a date it is simply that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
of the copy that has come under our own cognisance: many
of these works were of sufficient popularity to run through
several editions, sometimes several years apart; nevertheless
the dates we give will give an approximate notion that is
decidedly better than nothing. This list might readily be
extended tenfold.</p>

<p>The sphinx is described in Bacon&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The Wisdom
of the Ancients, Written in Latin by the Right Honourable
Sir Francis Bacon Knt. Baron of Verulam and Lord
Chancellor of England, and done into English by Sir Arthur
Gorges Knt.&rdquo; After narrating the story, he expounds it
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This Fable contains in it no less Wisdom than
Elegancy, and it seems to point at Science, especially that
which is joyn&rsquo;d with Practice, for Science may not absurdly
be call&rsquo;d a Monster, as being by the ignorant and rude
Multitude always held in Admiration. It is diverse in
Shape and Figure by reason of the infinite Variety of
Subjects wherein it is conversant. A Maiden Face and
Voice is attributed unto it for its gracious Countenance and
Volubility of Tongue. Wings are added, because Sciences
and their Inventions do pass and fly from one to another,
as it were in a Moment, seeing that the Communication of
Science is as the kindling of one Light at another. Elegantly
also it is feigned to have sharp and hooked Talons,
because the Axioms and Arguments of Science do fasten so
upon the Mind, and so strongly apprehend and hold it, as
that it stir not nor evade, which is noted also by the Divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
Philosopher&mdash;The Words of the Wise are as Goads and
Nails driven far in.</p>

<p>Moreover, all Science seems to be placed in steep and
high Mountains, as being thought to be a lofty and high
thing, looking down upon Ignorance with a scornful Eye.
It may be observed and seen also a great Way, and far in
compass, as things set on the Tops of Mountains.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Science may well be feigned to beset the
High-way, because which way soever we turn in this Progress
and Pilgrimage of Human Life we meet with some Matter
or Occasion offered for Contemplation. Sphynx is said to
have received from the Muses divers difficult Questions and
Riddles, and to propound them unto Men, which remaining
with the Muses are free (it may be) from savage Cruelty;
for, so long as there is no other end of Study and Meditation
than to know, the Understanding is not racked and imprisoned,
but enjoys Freedom and Liberty, and even Doubts and
Variety find a kind of Pleasure and Delectation. But when
once these Enigmas are delivered by the Muses to Sphynx,
that is, to Practice, so that it be sollicited and urged by
Action and Election and Determination, then they begin to
be troublesome and raging, and unless they be resolved and
expedited they do wonderfully torment and vex the Minds
of Men, distracting, and in a manner rending them into
sundry Parts.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is always a twofold Condition propounded
with Sphynx her Enigmas. To him that doth not expound
them, distraction of Mind, and to him that doth, a Kingdom,
for he that knows that which he sought to know hath
attain&rsquo;d the end he aim&rsquo;d at, and every Artificer also commands
over his Work.</p>

<p>Moreover it is added in the Fable, that the Body of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
Sphynx, when she was overcome, was laid upon an Ass,
which indeed is an elegant Fiction, seeing there is nothing
so acute and abstruse but, being well understood and
divulged, may be well apprehended by a slow Capacity.
Neither is it to be omitted that Sphynx was overcome by a
Man lame in his Feet; for when Men are too swift of Foot
and too speedy of Pace in hasting to Sphynx, her Enigmas,
it comes to pass that, she getting the upper Hand, their Wits
and Minds are rather distracted by Disputations than that
ever they come to command by Works and Effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spaces in the frieze of the Parthenon, known architectively
as the metopes, were filled with sculptures illustrating
the struggle between the Lapith&aelig; and the Centaurs. Thirty-nine
of these slabs remain in their original position in the
temple, while seventeen are in the British Museum and one
in the Louvre. In their beauty and bold design they are
some of the grandest monuments of Greek art. Other very
fine examples may be seen in the fragments in our national
collection from the frieze of the temple of Apollo Epicurius,
near Phigalia, and the Theseum at Athens. There are also
two very fine single statues of centaurs in the Capitoline
Museum.</p>

<p>Centaury is so called from an old myth that Chiron, the
centaur, cured himself from a wound given by a poisoned
arrow by using some plant that Pliny, therefore, calls <i>Centaurium</i>;
but whether it was this plant, or a knapweed, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
any plant at all, or whether there even ever was a centaur
named Chiron, or a centaur named anything else, are points
we must be content to leave. Linn&aelig;us called the plant the
<i>Chironia</i>; its modern generic name merely signifies red, as
most of the flowers in the genus have blossoms of some tint
of red; but in the specific name <i>Centaurium</i> we recognise
that the old myth still finds commemoration. In some parts
of England the rustics corrupt centaury into sanctuary, and
the Germans call it the <i>tausend-gulden-kraut</i>. This strange
name is built upon another corruption, some of the old
writers having twisted <i>Centaurea</i> into <i>Centum aurei</i>, and the
Germans have lavishly multiplied by ten the hundred golden
coins. The centaury is said to be a good and cheap substitute
for the medicinal gentian, and, as a hair-dye, was for a
long time held in repute for the production of a rich golden
yellow tint.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The centaury still figures largely in rustic medicine and in
the prescriptions of the herbalists; we have seen the country
agents of these latter with armfuls of centaury as large as
they could carry. Into all its accredited virtues in medi&aelig;val
times we need not here go; in fact, if our readers will make
out at random a list of some twenty of the ills of suffering
mortality, and boldly assert that such ills need not exist at
all in a world that also produces centaury, they will be sufficiently
near the mark for practical purposes.</p>

<p>An old author whose voluminous works on natural history
are very interesting and curious, and richly illustrated with
engravings at least as quaint in character as the text. The
&ldquo;Historia Monstrorum,&rdquo; was published in folio at Bologna
in 1642, and is full of the most extraordinary animal forms.
His various works range in date from 1602 to 1668, and are,
with one exception&mdash;Venice&mdash;published either at Bologna or
Frankfort. All are very curious, and will well repay our
readers if they can get an opportunity of seeing them.</p>

<h3><a name="appendixm" id="appendixm"></a>M.</h3>

<p>Bacon, in his &ldquo;Wisdom of the Ancients,&rdquo; writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Fable of the Syrens seems rightly to have been
apply&rsquo;d to the pernicious Allurements of Pleasure, but in a
very vulgar and gross manner. And therefore to me it seems
that the Wisdom of the Ancients have with a farther reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
or insight strained deeper Matter out of them, not unlike
the Grapes ill press&rsquo;d; from which though some Liquor
were drawn, yet the best was left behind. This Fable hath
relation to Men&rsquo;s Manners, and contains in it a manifest
and most excellent Parable. For Pleasures do for the most
proceed out of the Abundance and Superfluity of all things,
and also out of the Delights and jovial Contentments of the
Mind; the which are wont suddenly as it were with winged
Inticements to ravish and rap Mortal Men: But Learning and
Education brings it so to pass as that it restrains and bridles
Man&rsquo;s Mind, making it so to consider the Ends and Events
of Things as that it clips the Wings of Pleasure. These
Syrens are said to dwell in remote Isles: for that Pleasures
love Privacy and retired places, shunning always too much
Company of People. The Syren&rsquo;s Songs are so commonly
understood, together with the Deceits and Danger of them,
as that they need no Exposition. But that of the Bones
appearing like white Cliffs, and descry&rsquo;d afar off, hath more
Acuteness in it; for thereby it is signify&rsquo;d that, albeit the
Examples of Afflictions be manifest and eminent, yet do
they not sufficiently deter us from the wicked Enticements
of Pleasures.</p>

<p>As for the Remainder of this Parable, tho&rsquo; it be not over
mystical, yet it is very grave and excellent: For in it we
set out three Remedies for this violent enticing Mischief: to
wit, Two from Philosophy, and One from Religion. The first
Means to shun these inordinate Pleasures is to withstand
and resist them in their Beginnings and seriously to Shun
all Occasions to entice the Mind, which is signified in that
stopping of the Ears; and that Remedy is properly used by
the meaner and baser sort of People, as it were Ulysses
Followers or Mariners; whereas more heroick and noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
Spirits may boldly converse even in the midst of these
seducing Pleasures, if with a resolved Constancy they stand
upon their Guard and fortify their Minds; and so take
greater Contentment in the Trial and Experience of this
their approved Virtue, learning rather thoroughly to understand
the Follies and Vanities of those Pleasures by Contemplation,
than by Submission. Which Solomon avouched
of himself when he reckoned up the Multitude of those
Solaces and Pleasures wherein he swam, doth conclude with
this sentence&mdash;Wisdom also continued with me. Therefore
these Heroes, and Spirits of this excellent Temper, even in
the midst of these enticing Pleasures, can shew themselves
constant and invincible and are able to support their own
virtuous Inclination against all heady and forcible Perswasions
whatsoever; as by the Example of Ulysses, that so
peremptorily interdicted all pestilent Counsel as the most
dangerous and pernitious Poysons to captivate the Mind:
But of all other Remedies in this Case that of Orpheus is
most predominant: For they that chaunt and resound the
Praise of the Gods confound and dissipate the Voices and
Incantations of the Syrens, for Divine Meditations do not
only in Power subdue all sensual Pleasures, but also far
exceed them in Swiftness and Delight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before finally dismissing the Fairies we would just refer
our readers to a very curious book amongst the Lansdowne
MSS. (No. 231) in the British Museum. It was written by
John Aubrey, in the year 1686, and is entitled &ldquo;Remaines
of Gentilisme and Judaisme.&rdquo; The title, however, is no
guide whatever to the character of the book, which seems to
be merely a note-book for the writing down, without any
apparent system or order, of any curious matters that came
before him. Scattered throughout these notes are various
references to the Fairies; and though they naturally, to a
certain extent, repeat what we have already written, they are
perhaps sufficiently interesting to quote, as they were the
popular notions current at the time. We can only give
them in the disjointed way in which we find them, as they
are mixed up with all kinds of other matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far from S<sup>r</sup> Bennet Hoskyns there was a labouring
man that rose up early every day to goe to worke; who for
a good while many dayes together found a ninepence in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
way that he went. His wife wondering how he came by so
much money was afraid he gott it not honestlye; at last he
told her, and afterwards he never found any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were wont to please the Fairies, that they might
doe them no shrewd turnes, by sweeping clean the Hearth
and setting by it a dish of fair water half sad breade, whereon
was sett a messe of milke sopt with white bread. And on
the morrow they would find a groat of which if they did
speak of it they never had any again. M<sup>rs</sup> H. of Hereford
had as many groates or 3<sup>ds</sup> this way as made a little silver
cup or bowle of (I thinke) 3<sup>lbs</sup> value, wh her daughter
preserves still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the vestry at Frensham, on the N. side of the
chancel, is an extraordinary great kettle or caldron, which
the inhabitants say, by tradition, was brought hither by the
fairies, time out of mind, from Borough hill, about a mile
from hence. To this place, if any one went to borrow a yoke
of oxen, money, &amp;c., he might have it for a year or longer,
so he kept his word to return it. There is a cave, where
some have fancied to hear musick. On this Borough hill
is a great stone lying along, of the length of about six feet:
they went to this stone and knocked at it, and declared
what they would borrow and when they would pay, and a
voice would answer when they should come, and that they
should find what they desired to borrow at that stone.
This caldron, with the trivet, was borrowed here after the
manner aforesaid, but not returned according to promise,
and though the caldron was afterwards carried to the stone
it could not be received, and ever since that time no borrowing
there. The people saw a great fire one night not long
since, the next day they went to see if any heath was burnt
there, but found nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some were led away by the Fairies, as was a third
riding upon Hackpen with corn led a dance to ye Devises.
So was a shepherd of M<sup>r</sup> Brown of Winterburn-Basset,
but never any afterwards enjoy themselves. He sayd
that ye ground opened, and he was brought into strange
places underground, where they used musicall Instruments,
Viols and Lutes, such (he sayd) as M<sup>r</sup> Thomas did
play on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Virgil speakes somewhere (I think in ye Georgiques) of
Voyces heard louder than a Man&rsquo;s. M<sup>r</sup> Lancelot Morehouse
did averre to me that he did once heare such a loud
laugh on the other side of a hedge, and was sure that no
Human voice could afford such a laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Germany old women tell stories received from their
Ancestors that a Water-monster, called the Nickard, doth
enter by night the chamber, and stealeth when they are all
sleeping the new-born child, and supposeth another in
its place, which child growing up is like a monster and
commonly dumb. The remedy whereof that the Mother
may get her own child again&mdash;the mother taketh the Suppositium
and whipps it so long with the rod till the sayd
Monster, the Nickard, bringes the Mother&rsquo;s own child again,
and takes to him the Suppositium, which they call Wexel
balg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another curious old book on our shelves, the &ldquo;Philosophical
Grammar&rdquo; of Benjamin Martin, published in 1753, we
find another allusion to the belief in Fairies. The book is
written in the question and answer style once so popular, and
after a long dissertation on the Animal Kingdom, we come
at last to the question, &ldquo;Pray before we leave this survey of
the Animal Creation let me ask your opinion of Griffins, the
Ph&oelig;nix, Dragons, Satyrs, Syrens, Unicorns, Mermaids and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
Fairies. Do you think there really are any such things in
Nature?&rdquo; The answer is so far to the point, and so interesting
in itself as showing the state of mind on the whole
subject, that we give it in all its fulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> is mentioned by <i>Pliny</i>, and other Antients,
more credulous than skilful; but has long since been rejected
as a vulgar Error. The <i>Griffin</i> and <i>Harpy</i> have had a Place
given them in Modern Histories of Nature, but not without
great Reproach and Ridicule to the Authors. <i>Satyrs</i>,
<i>Syrens</i>, and <i>Fairies</i>, are all Poetical Fictions. The <i>Scripture</i>
makes mention of the <i>Dragon</i> and the <i>Unicorn</i>, and
most <i>Naturalists</i> have affirmed that there have been such
Creatures, and given Descriptions of them; but the Sight of
these Creatures or credible Relations of them, having been
so very rare, has occasioned many to believe there never
were any such Animals in Nature; at least it has made the
History of them very doubtful. As to <i>Mer-men</i> and <i>Mer-maids</i>,
there certainly are such Creatures in the Sea as have
some distant Resemblance of some Parts of the Human
Shape, Mien, and Members; but not so perfectly like them,
&rsquo;tis very probable, as has been represented. In all such
ambiguous Pieces of History &rsquo;tis better not to be positive,
and sometimes to suspend our Belief, rather than credulously
embrace every current Report, or vulgar Assertion which
may perhaps expose us to Ridicule.</p>

<p>It makes but little for the Credit of the Histories of
<i>Dragons</i>, <i>Unicorns</i>, <i>Mer-maids</i>, &amp;c., that their names are
not to be found in the Transactions of our celebrated Royal
Society, who, &rsquo;tis well known, derive their Intelligence at
the best Hand from almost all Parts of the World. At
least, I can find no mention of any such Creatures in the seven
Volumes of Abridgments by <i>Lowthorp, Eames, and Jones</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
2. The <i>Histoire Naturelle de l&rsquo;Universe</i> gives an Account
of several Persons who have described the <i>Unicorn</i>; and
particularly Father <i>Lobos</i>, in his Voyage to the <i>Abyssine
Empire</i>, says, that this Animal is of the Shape and Size of
a fine-made and well-proportion&rsquo;d Horse, of a bay Colour
with a black Tail and Extremities; he adds, that the
Unicorns of <i>Tuacua</i> have very short Tails; and those of
<i>Ninina</i> (a Canton in the same Province) have theirs very
long, and their Manes hanging over their Heads. <i>Vol.</i> IV.
<i>Page</i> 3.</p>

<p>3. <i>Du Mont</i> says, he saw the Head of a Dragon which
was set up over the <i>Water-Gate</i> in the City of <i>Rhodes</i>; this
Dragon was 33 Feet long, and wasted all the Country round,
&rsquo;till it was slain by <i>Deodate de Gozon</i>, a Knight of <i>St. John</i>.
He says, the <i>Head</i> was like that of an Hog, but much
larger; its <i>Ears</i> were like a Mule&rsquo;s, but cut off; the <i>Teeth</i>
were extraordinary sharp and long; the <i>Throat</i> wide; its
<i>Eyes</i> hollow, and burning like two Coals. It had two little
Wings on its Back; its <i>Legs</i> and <i>Tail</i> like those of a Lizard,
but strong, and arm&rsquo;d with sharp and venomous Talons.
His Body was cover&rsquo;d with Scales which was Proof against
Arms. See the Manner of his being kill&rsquo;d in the <i>Atlas
Geographicus</i>, Vol. III. Page 43, 44.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ludolphus</i>, in his <i>Ethiophic</i> History, tells us, that in
the <i>Abyssine Empire</i>, there are voracious scaly Dragons of
the largest Size, tho&rsquo; not venomous or hurtful otherwise than
by the Bite, and they look like the Bark of an old Tree.
<i>Atlas Geographicus</i>, Vol. IV. Page 614.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Stories</i> of <i>Mer-maids</i>, <i>Satyrs</i>, &amp;c. had undoubtedly
their Original from such Animals as have in some Respects
a Likeness to the <i>human Shape</i> and <i>Features</i>. Among these
the <i>Monkey</i> Kind, the <i>Orang-Outang</i>, and the <i>Quoja Morron</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
are the chief on Land; and the Fish call&rsquo;d the <i>Mermaid</i>
(tho&rsquo; it has nothing of the <i>Human Form</i>) and some other
unusual Animals in the Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where several sons are contemporaneous, and all have the
right to bear the paternal arms, they are thus distinguished&mdash;the
eldest son adds to them what is known as a label; the
second, a crescent; the third, a five-pointed star; the fourth,
a martlet; the fifth, an annulet; the sixth, a fleur-de-lys;
the seventh, a rose; and so on. A very good and easily
accessible example of this &ldquo;differencing&rdquo; of the arms may
be seen in those borne by the Prince of Wales, the silver
label stretching across the top of the shield, blazoned in
all other respects like those of the Queen, marking the relationship.</p>

<h3><a name="appendixr" id="appendixr"></a>R.</h3>

<p>Bruce tells us, for instance, that the horned viper, or
Cerastes, the &ldquo;worm of Nile&rdquo; that was the cause of the
death of Cleopatra, has a way of creeping until it is alongside
its victim, and then making a sudden sidelong spring at
the object of its attack. In his book he narrates a curious
instance that came under his notice at Cairo, where several
of these reptiles had been placed in a box. &ldquo;I saw one
crawl up the side, and there lie still, as if hiding himself, till
one of the people who brought them to us came near him
and though in a very disadvantageous position, sticking as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
it were perpendicularly to the side of the box, he leaped near
the distance of three feet, and fastened between the man&rsquo;s
forefinger and thumb.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="appendixs" id="appendixs"></a>S.</h3>

<p>Amongst the things displayed in the case are portions of
a wreath from the coffin of Rameses II. (1100-1200 <small>B.C.</small>),
composed of sepals and petals of <i>Nymph&aelig;a c&aelig;rulea</i> on strips
of leaves of the date-palm, and another wreath made from
the <i>N. Lotus</i>.</p>

<p>Another wreath is from the coffin of Aahmes I. (1700 <small>B.C.</small>),
composed of leaves of willow and flowers of the <i>Acacia
Nilotica</i>.</p>

<p>There are also two garlands from the tomb of the Princess
Nzi Khonsou (1000 <small>B.C.</small>), composed in the one case of willow
leaves and the flower heads of the <i>Centaur&aelig;a depressa</i>, and
in the other of the <i>Papaver Rh&aelig;as</i>, the common scarlet
poppy so familiar to every one who has ever seen an English
cornfield or railway embankment in summer.</p>

<p>There are, in addition, leaves of the wild celery and of the
olive and vine, all quite clearly distinguishable.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians were exceedingly fond of flowers,
and even made rare plants a portion of the tribute exacted
from dependent or conquered territories. One old writer
tells us that &ldquo;those flowers, which elsewhere were only
sparingly produced, even in their proper season, grew profusely
in Egypt at all times, so that neither roses, nor any
others, were wanting there, even in the middle of winter.&rdquo;
Their living rooms were always adorned with bouquets or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
growing plants, and the stands that served for holding them
have been found in the tombs. On the arrival of guests at
a banquet servants came forward with garlands of flowers
and placed them round their necks, a custom we may see
graphically depicted in the mural painting in the tombs,
while a single lotus flower was often placed in the hair.</p>

<h3><a name="appendixt" id="appendixt"></a>T.</h3>

<p>The Bay enters very largely into the various extraordinary
compounds&mdash;astrological, medicinal, and the like&mdash;of the
ancients. Thus&mdash;to quote but one instance out of many that
might be given&mdash;Albertus Magnus, in his treatise &ldquo;De Virtutibus
Herbarum,&rdquo; tells us that if any one gathers some bay
leaves and wraps them up with the tooth of a wolf, no one
can speak an angry word to the bearer; while, put under
the pillow at night, it will bring in a vision before the eyes of
a man who has been robbed, the thief and all his belongings.
He further goes on to tell us that if set up in a place of worship,
none who have broken any contract or agreement will
be able to quit the place till this most potent combination
be removed. &ldquo;This last is tried and most true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archaic and variant spelling is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired.</p>

<p>Hyphenation has been made consistent in the main body of the text,

<p>Page <a href="#Page_132">132</a> includes the phrase &ldquo;... but enough has been quoted to show

It seems that there is a word missing following &lsquo;have,&rsquo; but as there
is no way to determine with certainty what that word should be, it is
preserved as printed.</p>
